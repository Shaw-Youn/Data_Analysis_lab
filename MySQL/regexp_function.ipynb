    "## A. Regexp Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `REGEXP` function in MySQL is used for pattern matching with regular expressions. It allows you to search for specific patterns in strings, making it more flexible and powerful than using `LIKE` alone.\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "expression REGEXP pattern\n",

    "\n",
    "### Example Patterns with `REGEXP`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple Match**  \n",
    "   To find rows where the `conditions` column contains the word \"diabetes\" (case-insensitive):\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT * FROM patients WHERE conditions REGEXP 'diabetes';\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Match Beginning of String (`^`)**  \n",
    "   To find rows where `conditions` start with \"DIAB1\":\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT * FROM patients WHERE conditions REGEXP '^DIAB1';\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Match End of String (`$`)**  \n",
    "   To find rows where `conditions` end with \"DIAB1\":\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT * FROM patients WHERE conditions REGEXP 'DIAB1$';\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Word Boundary Matching**  \n",
    "   To match the exact code `DIAB1` in a space-separated list of codes, as in the previous example:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT * FROM patients WHERE conditions REGEXP '(^| )DIAB1( |$)';\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - `(^| )` matches the beginning of the string `^` or a space ` `.\n",
    "   - `DIAB1` matches the specific code.\n",
    "   - `( |$)` matches a space ` ` or the end of the string `$`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Case-Insensitive Matching**  \n",
    "   MySQL’s `REGEXP` is case-insensitive by default. If you want case-sensitive matching, use `REGEXP BINARY`.\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT * FROM patients WHERE conditions REGEXP BINARY 'DIAB1';\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Character Ranges and Classes**  \n",
    "   To find rows where `conditions` contain any digit:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT * FROM patients WHERE conditions REGEXP '[0-9]';\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Or using character classes for digits:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT * FROM patients WHERE conditions REGEXP '[[:digit:]]';\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Finding Specific Codes**  \n",
    "  Suppose you have condition codes in different formats like `DIAB1`, `DIAB2`, `CARD1`, etc., and you want to retrieve all diabetes-related codes (`DIAB`). You can use:\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT * FROM patients WHERE conditions REGEXP 'DIAB[0-9]';\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  This will match any string containing `DIAB` followed by a digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complex Pattern Matching**  \n",
    "  If you want to find conditions that have either `DIAB1` or `CARD1`, use:\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT * FROM patients WHERE conditions REGEXP 'DIAB1|CARD1';\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a table with columns `patient_id`, `patient_name`, and `conditions`:\n",
    "\n",
    "To find patients who have a condition code starting with \"DIAB1\" for Type I Diabetes, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    patient_id,\n",
    "    patient_name,\n",
    "    conditions\n",
    "FROM \n",
    "    patients\n",
    "WHERE \n",
    "    conditions REGEXP '(^| )DIAB1( |$)';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "The `REGEXP` function is powerful for pattern matching in MySQL. It enables complex search criteria with patterns, providing flexibility beyond `LIKE` by allowing conditions based on exact sequences, repetitions, and custom patterns."

    " ## B. Patten Matching Functions \n",
    " MySQL provides several functions and operators to perform pattern matching in strings. Here’s an overview of the most commonly used ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `LIKE` Operator\n",
    "The `LIKE` operator is used for simple pattern matching, often with wildcards (`%` and `_`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "expression LIKE pattern\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`%`**: Matches any sequence of characters (including no characters).\n",
    "- **`_`**: Matches any single character.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage\n",
    "To find records where the `name` contains \"John\":\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM patients WHERE name LIKE '%John%';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `NOT LIKE` Operator\n",
    "`NOT LIKE` is the opposite of `LIKE`, used to find strings that do not match a specified pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage\n",
    "To find records where `name` does not contain \"John\":\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM patients WHERE name NOT LIKE '%John%';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `REGEXP` (or `RLIKE`) Operator\n",
    "`REGEXP` (also called `RLIKE`) is a powerful operator that allows for regular expression matching. It enables complex pattern searches that go beyond simple wildcard matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "expression REGEXP pattern\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "- To match strings starting with \"DIAB\":\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT * FROM patients WHERE conditions REGEXP '^DIAB';\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- To find records containing \"DIAB1\" or \"CARD1\":\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT * FROM patients WHERE conditions REGEXP 'DIAB1|CARD1';\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Commonly Used Patterns with `REGEXP`\n",
    "- `^pattern`: Match at the beginning of a string.\n",
    "- `pattern$`: Match at the end of a string.\n",
    "- `pattern1|pattern2`: Match either pattern1 or pattern2.\n",
    "- `[a-z]`: Match any lowercase letter from a to z.\n",
    "- `[0-9]`: Match any digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. `INSTR()` Function\n",
    "`INSTR()` returns the position of the first occurrence of a substring within a string. It’s useful when you need to check for the presence of a substring and get its position.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSTR(string, substring)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage\n",
    "To find patients where the `conditions` column contains \"DIAB1\":\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM patients WHERE INSTR(conditions, 'DIAB1') > 0;\n",
    "```\n",
    "If the result is greater than `0`, it means \"DIAB1\" is found within the `conditions` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. `LOCATE()` Function\n",
    "`LOCATE()` is similar to `INSTR()` but with additional options. It returns the position of a substring within a string and allows specifying a starting position for the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "LOCATE(substring, string, start_position)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **start_position** (optional): Specifies the position to start the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage\n",
    "To search for \"DIAB1\" in the `conditions` column starting from the third character:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM patients WHERE LOCATE('DIAB1', conditions, 3) > 0;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. `POSITION()` Function\n",
    "`POSITION()` is an alternative to `LOCATE()` and `INSTR()` for finding the position of a substring within a string. It’s an ANSI SQL standard function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "POSITION(substring IN string)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage\n",
    "To find where \"DIAB1\" occurs in `conditions`:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM patients WHERE POSITION('DIAB1' IN conditions) > 0;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. `SUBSTRING_INDEX()` Function\n",
    "`SUBSTRING_INDEX()` allows you to extract a substring from a string based on a delimiter, which can help find specific parts of a string in a structured format.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SUBSTRING_INDEX(string, delimiter, count)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **string**: The original string.\n",
    "- **delimiter**: The character or string that separates parts of `string`.\n",
    "- **count**: If positive, `count` specifies the number of delimiters to scan from the start of the string. If negative, it scans from the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage\n",
    "If you want the part before the first space in `conditions`:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT SUBSTRING_INDEX(conditions, ' ', 1) FROM patients;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. `SOUNDEX()` Function\n",
    "`SOUNDEX()` converts a string to a four-character code based on its pronunciation, making it useful for finding similar-sounding words.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SOUNDEX(string)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage\n",
    "To find names that sound like \"Jon\":\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM patients WHERE SOUNDEX(name) = SOUNDEX('Jon');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. `MATCH ... AGAINST` (Full-Text Search)\n",
    "For text-based searches on large datasets, MySQL’s Full-Text Search (`MATCH ... AGAINST`) is ideal. It requires a FULLTEXT index and can search for words and phrases, handling stopwords, relevancy, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "MATCH(column_name) AGAINST ('search terms' [IN BOOLEAN MODE])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IN BOOLEAN MODE**: Allows the use of Boolean operators (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, etc.) to refine the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM patients WHERE MATCH(conditions) AGAINST ('DIAB1' IN BOOLEAN MODE);\n",

    "## C. Group_concat Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In MySQL, `GROUP_CONCAT()` is an aggregation function that combines values from multiple rows into a single string. It’s particularly useful for concatenating values from rows grouped by a specific column, often used with `GROUP BY`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "GROUP_CONCAT([DISTINCT] expression [ORDER BY expression] [SEPARATOR 'separator'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components:\n",
    "- **`expression`**: The column or expression whose values you want to concatenate.\n",
    "- **`DISTINCT`**: (Optional) Ensures that duplicate values are not included in the concatenated result.\n",
    "- **`ORDER BY expression`**: (Optional) Specifies the order in which the values are concatenated.\n",
    "- **`SEPARATOR 'separator'`**: (Optional) Defines a custom separator between concatenated values. The default is a comma (`,`), but you can specify any separator you need (e.g., a space or a hyphen).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Use Cases:\n",
    "1. **Concatenate Product Names by Date**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Suppose you have a table `sales_table` with `sell_date` and `product` columns. You want a list of products sold each day, separated by commas:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT \n",
    "       sell_date,\n",
    "       GROUP_CONCAT(product) AS product_list\n",
    "   FROM \n",

    "   GROUP BY \n",
    "       sell_date;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Result**: Each date will display a comma-separated list of products sold on that day.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Order the Concatenated Values**\n",
    "\n",
    "   If you want the product names to be listed in alphabetical order for each date:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT \n",
    "       sell_date,\n",
    "       GROUP_CONCAT(product ORDER BY product ASC) AS product_list\n",

    "   GROUP BY \n",
    "       sell_date;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Result**: The `product_list` will show products sorted alphabetically for each date.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Remove Duplicates with `DISTINCT`**\n",
    "\n",
    "   To ensure each product appears only once per date, use `DISTINCT`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT \n",
    "       sell_date,\n",
    "       GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product ASC) AS product_list\n",
    "   FROM \n",
    "       sales_table\n",
    "   GROUP BY \n",
    "       sell_date;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Result**: The `product_list` will contain unique, sorted products for each `sell_date`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use a Custom Separator**\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can customize the separator. For instance, if you want a `|` instead of a comma:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT \n",
    "       sell_date,\n",
    "       GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product ASC SEPARATOR ' | ') AS product_list\n",
    "   FROM \n",
    "       sales_table\n",
    "   GROUP BY \n",
    "       sell_date;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Limit:\n",
    "MySQL limits the result of `GROUP_CONCAT()` to 1024 characters by default. You can increase this limit with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SET SESSION group_concat_max_len = 10000;  -- Set the limit to 10,000 characters\n",

    "## D. Apache Spark SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Apache Spark SQL**, the `GROUP_CONCAT()` function is not directly available as it is in MySQL. However, you can achieve similar functionality using the `collect_list()` or `collect_set()` functions in Spark SQL, which allow you to aggregate data into a list or set, respectively. To concatenate the values, you can then apply `concat_ws()` (concatenate with separator) on the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here’s how you can achieve the same result in Spark SQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using `collect_list()` with `concat_ws()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "   `collect_list()` aggregates the values into an array, and `concat_ws()` can be used to concatenate the values in the array with a separator.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "   Suppose you have a DataFrame `df` with columns `sell_date` and `product`, and you want to concatenate the product names for each `sell_date` into a single string separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT \n",
    "       sell_date,\n",
    "       concat_ws(',', collect_list(product)) AS product_list\n",
    "   FROM \n",
    "       sales_table\n",
    "   GROUP BY \n",
    "       sell_date;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   ### Explanation:\n",
    "   - `collect_list(product)`: Collects all the product values for each `sell_date` into an array.\n",
    "   - `concat_ws(',', ...)`: Concatenates the values in the array into a single string, with each value separated by a comma (`,`).\n",
    "   - `GROUP BY sell_date`: Groups the results by `sell_date`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using `collect_set()` for Unique Values**\n",
    "\n",
    "   If you want to make sure that the product names are unique, use `collect_set()` instead of `collect_list()`. It eliminates duplicates before concatenating.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT \n",
    "       sell_date,\n",
    "       concat_ws(',', collect_set(product)) AS product_list\n",
    "   FROM \n",
    "       sales_table\n",
    "   GROUP BY \n",
    "       sell_date;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `collect_set(product)`: Collects unique product names for each `sell_date`.\n",
    "   - `concat_ws(',', ...)`: Concatenates the unique values in the set into a single string separated by a comma.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sorting the Concatenated Values:\n",
    "If you need the product names to be sorted lexicographically, you would first need to sort the list and then concatenate them. In Spark SQL, this can be achieved by using a combination of `sort_array()` and `concat_ws()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    sell_date,\n",
    "    concat_ws(',', sort_array(collect_set(product))) AS product_list\n",
    "FROM \n",
    "    sales_table\n",
    "GROUP BY \n",
    "    sell_date;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- `collect_set(product)`: Collects unique products.\n",
    "- `sort_array()`: Sorts the array in ascending order.\n",
    "- `concat_ws(',', ...)`: Concatenates the sorted array into a comma-separated string.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will give you a lexicographically sorted, comma-separated list of unique product names for each `sell_date`."

    "## E. Other Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "In the regular expression `^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9._-]*@leetcode\\\\.com$`, the sequence `\\\\.` is used to match a **literal period (dot)** in the domain name (`@leetcode.com`). Here’s a detailed breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of Each Part\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`^`**: Asserts the start of the string. This ensures the pattern matches from the beginning of the email address.\n",
    "- **`[A-Za-z]`**: Ensures the prefix starts with a letter (either uppercase `A-Z` or lowercase `a-z`).\n",
    "- **`[A-Za-z0-9._-]*`**: Matches zero or more characters that can be:\n",
    "  - **Letters** (`A-Za-z`)\n",
    "  - **Digits** (`0-9`)\n",
    "  - **Underscore** (`_`)\n",
    "  - **Period** (`.`)\n",
    "  - **Dash** (`-`)\n",
    "\n",
    "   The `*` after the character set allows any number of these characters after the initial letter, including none at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`@leetcode\\\\.com`**: Matches the exact domain `@leetcode.com`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `\\\\.` Explanation\n",
    "- **`.` (dot)** in regular expressions is a special character that matches any single character. For example, `a.c` would match \"abc,\" \"a-c,\" \"a.c,\" etc.\n",
    "- **`\\\\.`** (double backslash before the dot) is used to **escape** the dot, so it matches a literal period (`.`) instead of any character. \n",
    "   - In MySQL regular expressions, a single backslash `\\` is used to escape special characters. However, in SQL strings, you need to **double the backslash** (`\\\\`) because a single backslash is treated as an escape character in SQL strings themselves.\n",
    "   - So, `\\\\.` in the regular expression ultimately translates to `\\.` in regex syntax, which matches an actual period `.` in the email domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`com$`**: Matches the literal string \"com\" at the end of the email address. The `$` asserts the end of the string, ensuring there are no additional characters after \"com\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "The pattern `^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9._-]*@leetcode\\\\.com$` thus matches an email with:\n",
    "1. A prefix that starts with a letter and is followed by any number of valid characters (letters, digits, underscores, dots, or dashes).\n",
    "2. The exact domain `@leetcode.com`, with a literal period (`.`) between \"leetcode\" and \"com\"."
