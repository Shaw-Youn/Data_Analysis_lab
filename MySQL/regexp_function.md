## A. Regexp Function

The `REGEXP` function in MySQL is used for pattern matching with regular expressions. It allows you to search for specific patterns in strings, making it more flexible and powerful than using `LIKE` alone.

### Syntax
```sql
expression REGEXP pattern
```

- **expression**: The column or string you want to search within.
- **pattern**: The regular expression pattern you want to match.

If `REGEXP` finds a match, it returns `1`; if not, it returns `0`.

### Basic Regular Expression Patterns
Here are some useful regular expression patterns and their meanings:

| Pattern     | Description                                                                                           |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `^pattern`  | Matches if `pattern` is at the **beginning** of the string.                                           |
| `pattern$`  | Matches if `pattern` is at the **end** of the string.                                                 |
| `.`         | Matches **any single character** except a newline.                                                    |
| `[abc]`     | Matches any **single character** in the set (e.g., `a`, `b`, or `c`).                                 |
| `[^abc]`    | Matches any **single character not in the set** (e.g., any character except `a`, `b`, or `c`).        |
| `[a-z]`     | Matches any **single character in the range** (e.g., any lowercase letter from `a` to `z`).           |
| `pattern*`  | Matches **zero or more** occurrences of `pattern`.                                                    |
| `pattern+`  | Matches **one or more** occurrences of `pattern`.                                                     |
| `pattern?`  | Matches **zero or one** occurrence of `pattern`.                                                      |
| `pattern1|pattern2` | Matches either `pattern1` or `pattern2`.                                                     |
| `(pattern)` | Groups patterns together.                                                                             |
| `{n}`       | Matches **exactly n occurrences** of the preceding pattern.                                           |
| `{n,}`      | Matches **n or more occurrences** of the preceding pattern.                                           |
| `{n,m}`     | Matches **between n and m occurrences** of the preceding pattern.                                     |
| `[:<class>:]` | Matches a **character class** (e.g., `[:digit:]`, `[:alpha:]`, `[:space:]`).                       |

### Example Patterns with `REGEXP`

1. **Simple Match**  
   To find rows where the `conditions` column contains the word "diabetes" (case-insensitive):
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM patients WHERE conditions REGEXP 'diabetes';
   ```

2. **Match Beginning of String (`^`)**  
   To find rows where `conditions` start with "DIAB1":
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM patients WHERE conditions REGEXP '^DIAB1';
   ```

3. **Match End of String (`$`)**  
   To find rows where `conditions` end with "DIAB1":
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM patients WHERE conditions REGEXP 'DIAB1$';
   ```

4. **Word Boundary Matching**  
   To match the exact code `DIAB1` in a space-separated list of codes, as in the previous example:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM patients WHERE conditions REGEXP '(^| )DIAB1( |$)';
   ```
   - `(^| )` matches the beginning of the string `^` or a space ` `.
   - `DIAB1` matches the specific code.
   - `( |$)` matches a space ` ` or the end of the string `$`.

5. **Case-Insensitive Matching**  
   MySQL’s `REGEXP` is case-insensitive by default. If you want case-sensitive matching, use `REGEXP BINARY`.
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM patients WHERE conditions REGEXP BINARY 'DIAB1';
   ```

6. **Character Ranges and Classes**  
   To find rows where `conditions` contain any digit:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM patients WHERE conditions REGEXP '[0-9]';
   ```
   Or using character classes for digits:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM patients WHERE conditions REGEXP '[[:digit:]]';
   ```

### Practical Use Cases

- **Finding Specific Codes**  
  Suppose you have condition codes in different formats like `DIAB1`, `DIAB2`, `CARD1`, etc., and you want to retrieve all diabetes-related codes (`DIAB`). You can use:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM patients WHERE conditions REGEXP 'DIAB[0-9]';
  ```
  This will match any string containing `DIAB` followed by a digit.

- **Complex Pattern Matching**  
  If you want to find conditions that have either `DIAB1` or `CARD1`, use:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM patients WHERE conditions REGEXP 'DIAB1|CARD1';
  ```

### Example Scenario

Given a table with columns `patient_id`, `patient_name`, and `conditions`:

To find patients who have a condition code starting with "DIAB1" for Type I Diabetes, use:

```sql
SELECT 
    patient_id,
    patient_name,
    conditions
FROM 
    patients
WHERE 
    conditions REGEXP '(^| )DIAB1( |$)';
```

### Summary
The `REGEXP` function is powerful for pattern matching in MySQL. It enables complex search criteria with patterns, providing flexibility beyond `LIKE` by allowing conditions based on exact sequences, repetitions, and custom patterns.

 ## B. Patten Matching Functions 
 MySQL provides several functions and operators to perform pattern matching in strings. Here’s an overview of the most commonly used ones:

### 1. `LIKE` Operator
The `LIKE` operator is used for simple pattern matching, often with wildcards (`%` and `_`).

#### Syntax
```sql
expression LIKE pattern
```

- **`%`**: Matches any sequence of characters (including no characters).
- **`_`**: Matches any single character.

#### Example Usage
To find records where the `name` contains "John":
```sql
SELECT * FROM patients WHERE name LIKE '%John%';
```

### 2. `NOT LIKE` Operator
`NOT LIKE` is the opposite of `LIKE`, used to find strings that do not match a specified pattern.

#### Example Usage
To find records where `name` does not contain "John":
```sql
SELECT * FROM patients WHERE name NOT LIKE '%John%';
```

### 3. `REGEXP` (or `RLIKE`) Operator
`REGEXP` (also called `RLIKE`) is a powerful operator that allows for regular expression matching. It enables complex pattern searches that go beyond simple wildcard matching.

#### Syntax
```sql
expression REGEXP pattern
```

#### Examples
- To match strings starting with "DIAB":
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM patients WHERE conditions REGEXP '^DIAB';
  ```
- To find records containing "DIAB1" or "CARD1":
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM patients WHERE conditions REGEXP 'DIAB1|CARD1';
  ```

#### Commonly Used Patterns with `REGEXP`
- `^pattern`: Match at the beginning of a string.
- `pattern$`: Match at the end of a string.
- `pattern1|pattern2`: Match either pattern1 or pattern2.
- `[a-z]`: Match any lowercase letter from a to z.
- `[0-9]`: Match any digit.

### 4. `INSTR()` Function
`INSTR()` returns the position of the first occurrence of a substring within a string. It’s useful when you need to check for the presence of a substring and get its position.

#### Syntax
```sql
INSTR(string, substring)
```

#### Example Usage
To find patients where the `conditions` column contains "DIAB1":
```sql
SELECT * FROM patients WHERE INSTR(conditions, 'DIAB1') > 0;
```
If the result is greater than `0`, it means "DIAB1" is found within the `conditions` column.

### 5. `LOCATE()` Function
`LOCATE()` is similar to `INSTR()` but with additional options. It returns the position of a substring within a string and allows specifying a starting position for the search.

#### Syntax
```sql
LOCATE(substring, string, start_position)
```

- **start_position** (optional): Specifies the position to start the search.

#### Example Usage
To search for "DIAB1" in the `conditions` column starting from the third character:
```sql
SELECT * FROM patients WHERE LOCATE('DIAB1', conditions, 3) > 0;
```

### 6. `POSITION()` Function
`POSITION()` is an alternative to `LOCATE()` and `INSTR()` for finding the position of a substring within a string. It’s an ANSI SQL standard function.

#### Syntax
```sql
POSITION(substring IN string)
```

#### Example Usage
To find where "DIAB1" occurs in `conditions`:
```sql
SELECT * FROM patients WHERE POSITION('DIAB1' IN conditions) > 0;
```

### 7. `SUBSTRING_INDEX()` Function
`SUBSTRING_INDEX()` allows you to extract a substring from a string based on a delimiter, which can help find specific parts of a string in a structured format.

#### Syntax
```sql
SUBSTRING_INDEX(string, delimiter, count)
```

- **string**: The original string.
- **delimiter**: The character or string that separates parts of `string`.
- **count**: If positive, `count` specifies the number of delimiters to scan from the start of the string. If negative, it scans from the end.

#### Example Usage
If you want the part before the first space in `conditions`:
```sql
SELECT SUBSTRING_INDEX(conditions, ' ', 1) FROM patients;
```

### 8. `SOUNDEX()` Function
`SOUNDEX()` converts a string to a four-character code based on its pronunciation, making it useful for finding similar-sounding words.

#### Syntax
```sql
SOUNDEX(string)
```

#### Example Usage
To find names that sound like "Jon":
```sql
SELECT * FROM patients WHERE SOUNDEX(name) = SOUNDEX('Jon');
```

### 9. `MATCH ... AGAINST` (Full-Text Search)
For text-based searches on large datasets, MySQL’s Full-Text Search (`MATCH ... AGAINST`) is ideal. It requires a FULLTEXT index and can search for words and phrases, handling stopwords, relevancy, and more.

#### Syntax
```sql
MATCH(column_name) AGAINST ('search terms' [IN BOOLEAN MODE])
```

- **IN BOOLEAN MODE**: Allows the use of Boolean operators (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, etc.) to refine the search.

#### Example Usage
```sql
SELECT * FROM patients WHERE MATCH(conditions) AGAINST ('DIAB1' IN BOOLEAN MODE);
```

Each of these functions and operators can help perform pattern matching effectively in MySQL, depending on the complexity and requirements of the search criteria.

## C. Group_concat Function

In MySQL, `GROUP_CONCAT()` is an aggregation function that combines values from multiple rows into a single string. It’s particularly useful for concatenating values from rows grouped by a specific column, often used with `GROUP BY`. 

### Syntax:
```sql
GROUP_CONCAT([DISTINCT] expression [ORDER BY expression] [SEPARATOR 'separator'])
```

### Key Components:
- **`expression`**: The column or expression whose values you want to concatenate.
- **`DISTINCT`**: (Optional) Ensures that duplicate values are not included in the concatenated result.
- **`ORDER BY expression`**: (Optional) Specifies the order in which the values are concatenated.
- **`SEPARATOR 'separator'`**: (Optional) Defines a custom separator between concatenated values. The default is a comma (`,`), but you can specify any separator you need (e.g., a space or a hyphen).

### Example Use Cases:
1. **Concatenate Product Names by Date**

   Suppose you have a table `sales_table` with `sell_date` and `product` columns. You want a list of products sold each day, separated by commas:

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       sell_date,
       GROUP_CONCAT(product) AS product_list
   FROM 
       sales_table
   GROUP BY 
       sell_date;
   ```

   - **Result**: Each date will display a comma-separated list of products sold on that day.

2. **Order the Concatenated Values**

   If you want the product names to be listed in alphabetical order for each date:

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       sell_date,
       GROUP_CONCAT(product ORDER BY product ASC) AS product_list
   FROM 
       sales_table
   GROUP BY 
       sell_date;
   ```

   - **Result**: The `product_list` will show products sorted alphabetically for each date.

3. **Remove Duplicates with `DISTINCT`**

   To ensure each product appears only once per date, use `DISTINCT`:

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       sell_date,
       GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product ASC) AS product_list
   FROM 
       sales_table
   GROUP BY 
       sell_date;
   ```

   - **Result**: The `product_list` will contain unique, sorted products for each `sell_date`.

4. **Use a Custom Separator**

   You can customize the separator. For instance, if you want a `|` instead of a comma:

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       sell_date,
       GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product ASC SEPARATOR ' | ') AS product_list
   FROM 
       sales_table
   GROUP BY 
       sell_date;
   ```

### Practical Limit:
MySQL limits the result of `GROUP_CONCAT()` to 1024 characters by default. You can increase this limit with:

```sql
SET SESSION group_concat_max_len = 10000;  -- Set the limit to 10,000 characters
```

This is helpful if the concatenated results might be lengthy.

## D. Apache Spark SQL

In **Apache Spark SQL**, the `GROUP_CONCAT()` function is not directly available as it is in MySQL. However, you can achieve similar functionality using the `collect_list()` or `collect_set()` functions in Spark SQL, which allow you to aggregate data into a list or set, respectively. To concatenate the values, you can then apply `concat_ws()` (concatenate with separator) on the result.

### Here’s how you can achieve the same result in Spark SQL:

1. **Using `collect_list()` with `concat_ws()`**

   `collect_list()` aggregates the values into an array, and `concat_ws()` can be used to concatenate the values in the array with a separator.

   **Example:**
   Suppose you have a DataFrame `df` with columns `sell_date` and `product`, and you want to concatenate the product names for each `sell_date` into a single string separated by commas.

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       sell_date,
       concat_ws(',', collect_list(product)) AS product_list
   FROM 
       sales_table
   GROUP BY 
       sell_date;
   ```

   ### Explanation:
   - `collect_list(product)`: Collects all the product values for each `sell_date` into an array.
   - `concat_ws(',', ...)`: Concatenates the values in the array into a single string, with each value separated by a comma (`,`).
   - `GROUP BY sell_date`: Groups the results by `sell_date`.

2. **Using `collect_set()` for Unique Values**

   If you want to make sure that the product names are unique, use `collect_set()` instead of `collect_list()`. It eliminates duplicates before concatenating.

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       sell_date,
       concat_ws(',', collect_set(product)) AS product_list
   FROM 
       sales_table
   GROUP BY 
       sell_date;
   ```

   - `collect_set(product)`: Collects unique product names for each `sell_date`.
   - `concat_ws(',', ...)`: Concatenates the unique values in the set into a single string separated by a comma.

### Sorting the Concatenated Values:
If you need the product names to be sorted lexicographically, you would first need to sort the list and then concatenate them. In Spark SQL, this can be achieved by using a combination of `sort_array()` and `concat_ws()`.

```sql
SELECT 
    sell_date,
    concat_ws(',', sort_array(collect_set(product))) AS product_list
FROM 
    sales_table
GROUP BY 
    sell_date;
```

### Explanation:
- `collect_set(product)`: Collects unique products.
- `sort_array()`: Sorts the array in ascending order.
- `concat_ws(',', ...)`: Concatenates the sorted array into a comma-separated string.

This will give you a lexicographically sorted, comma-separated list of unique product names for each `sell_date`.

## E. Other Cases

In the regular expression `^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9._-]*@leetcode\\.com$`, the sequence `\\.` is used to match a **literal period (dot)** in the domain name (`@leetcode.com`). Here’s a detailed breakdown:

### Explanation of Each Part

- **`^`**: Asserts the start of the string. This ensures the pattern matches from the beginning of the email address.
- **`[A-Za-z]`**: Ensures the prefix starts with a letter (either uppercase `A-Z` or lowercase `a-z`).
- **`[A-Za-z0-9._-]*`**: Matches zero or more characters that can be:
  - **Letters** (`A-Za-z`)
  - **Digits** (`0-9`)
  - **Underscore** (`_`)
  - **Period** (`.`)
  - **Dash** (`-`)

   The `*` after the character set allows any number of these characters after the initial letter, including none at all.

- **`@leetcode\\.com`**: Matches the exact domain `@leetcode.com`.

### `\\.` Explanation
- **`.` (dot)** in regular expressions is a special character that matches any single character. For example, `a.c` would match "abc," "a-c," "a.c," etc.
- **`\\.`** (double backslash before the dot) is used to **escape** the dot, so it matches a literal period (`.`) instead of any character. 
   - In MySQL regular expressions, a single backslash `\` is used to escape special characters. However, in SQL strings, you need to **double the backslash** (`\\`) because a single backslash is treated as an escape character in SQL strings themselves.
   - So, `\\.` in the regular expression ultimately translates to `\.` in regex syntax, which matches an actual period `.` in the email domain.

- **`com$`**: Matches the literal string "com" at the end of the email address. The `$` asserts the end of the string, ensuring there are no additional characters after "com".

### Summary
The pattern `^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9._-]*@leetcode\\.com$` thus matches an email with:
1. A prefix that starts with a letter and is followed by any number of valid characters (letters, digits, underscores, dots, or dashes).
2. The exact domain `@leetcode.com`, with a literal period (`.`) between "leetcode" and "com".
