    "## A. MySQL connection in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Jupyter notebook, we can use the following two method to start MySQL\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Magic MySQL\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "%load_ext sql\n",
    "%sql mysql + pymysql://root:password@hostname/dbname\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Python\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To use `mysql.connector` in a Jupyter notebook, you'll first need to install the `mysql-connector-python` package if you haven't done so already. Then, you can connect to a MySQL database, execute queries, and insert data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a step-by-step guide:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Install `mysql-connector-python`\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following command to install `mysql-connector-python` if it's not already installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "!pip install mysql-connector-python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Import `mysql.connector` and Create Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to import the `mysql.connector` module and create a connection to your MySQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mysql.connector\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a connection to the MySQL database\n",
    "connection = mysql.connector.connect(\n",
    "    host='localhost',       # Replace with your host, e.g., 'localhost'\n",
    "    user='your_username',   # Replace with your MySQL username\n",
    "    password='your_password',  # Replace with your MySQL password\n",

    "# Check if the connection is successful\n",
    "if connection.is_connected():\n",
    "    print(\"Connected to MySQL database\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Create a Cursor and Execute Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "A cursor object allows you to execute queries and fetch data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a cursor object\n",
    "cursor = connection.cursor()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Write your SQL query\n",

    "# Display the results\n",
    "for row in result:\n",
    "    print(row)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Insert Data with Parameterized Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can use parameterized queries to insert data safely into your MySQL table. Here's an example of inserting multiple rows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# SQL insert query with placeholders (%s)\n",
    "insert_query = \"INSERT INTO your_table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (%s, %s)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data to be inserted\n",
    "data = [\n",
    "    ('value1', 123),\n",
    "    ('value2', 456),\n",
    "    ('value3', 789)\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Execute the insert query with the data\n",
    "cursor.executemany(insert_query, data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Commit the transaction\n",
    "connection.commit()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"{cursor.rowcount} rows were inserted.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`executemany()`** is used to insert multiple rows at once.\n",
    "- **`%s`** placeholders in the SQL query represent the values that will be inserted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Handling Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "You can handle potential errors that might occur while connecting to the database or executing queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "from mysql.connector import Error\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    connection = mysql.connector.connect(\n",

    "        password='your_password',\n",
    "        database='your_database'\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if connection.is_connected():\n",
    "        print(\"Connected to MySQL database\")\n",
    "\n",
    "        cursor = connection.cursor()\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Example select query\n",
    "        query = \"SELECT * FROM your_table_name\"\n",
    "        cursor.execute(query)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        result = cursor.fetchall()\n",
    "        \n",
    "        for row in result:\n",
    "            print(row)\n",
    "\n",
    "except Error as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    if connection.is_connected():\n",
    "        cursor.close()\n",
    "        connection.close()\n",
    "        print(\"MySQL connection is closed\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Closing the Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "After you're done with your operations, it’s a good practice to close both the cursor and the connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Close the cursor and connection\n",
    "cursor.close()\n",
    "connection.close()\n",
    "\n",

    "## B. Other MySQL Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "you can use other MySQL operations like `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, executing stored procedures, stored functions, and working with events and triggers using `mysql.connector` in Python. Below are examples of how to perform these operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Update Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `UPDATE` statement to modify existing records in a MySQL table.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mysql.connector\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establish connection\n",
    "connection = mysql.connector.connect(\n",
    "    host='localhost',\n",
    "    user='your_username',\n",
    "    password='your_password',\n",
    "    database='your_database'\n",

    "data_to_update = ('new_value', 123)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Execute the update query\n",
    "cursor.execute(update_query, data_to_update)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Commit the transaction\n",
    "connection.commit()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"{cursor.rowcount} rows were updated.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close the cursor and connection\n",
    "cursor.close()\n",
    "connection.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Delete Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `DELETE` statement to remove records from a MySQL table.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# SQL Delete query\n",
    "delete_query = \"DELETE FROM your_table_name WHERE column2 = %s\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data for deletion\n",
    "data_to_delete = (123,)\n",

    "# Commit the transaction\n",
    "connection.commit()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"{cursor.rowcount} rows were deleted.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Calling Stored Procedures**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can call a stored procedure using the `callproc()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example stored procedure call\n",
    "procedure_name = 'your_procedure_name'\n",
    "args = (param1, param2)  # If your procedure takes arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "# Execute the stored procedure\n",
    "cursor.callproc(procedure_name, args)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fetch the results (if the procedure returns data)\n",
    "for result in cursor.stored_results():\n",
    "    data = result.fetchall()\n",
    "    print(data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Calling Stored Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a stored function that returns a value, you can use a `SELECT` statement to retrieve its result.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# SQL query to call a stored function\n",
    "function_call = \"SELECT your_function_name(%s, %s)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data for function parameters\n",
    "function_args = (param1, param2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Execute the function\n",
    "cursor.execute(function_call, function_args)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fetch the result\n",
    "result = cursor.fetchone()\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Working with Triggers**\n",
    "\n",
    "Triggers are executed automatically when certain events occur (e.g., before or after an insert, update, or delete). You typically create triggers using a DDL statement, and once they are defined, they work independently of your Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you can still create or manage triggers using Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# SQL query to create a trigger\n",
    "create_trigger_query = \"\"\"\n",
    "CREATE TRIGGER before_insert_trigger\n",
    "BEFORE INSERT ON your_table_name\n",
    "FOR EACH ROW\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    -- Your trigger logic here\n",
    "END;\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Execute the trigger creation query\n",
    "cursor.execute(create_trigger_query)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Commit the transaction\n",
    "connection.commit()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Creating Events**\n",
    "\n",
    "MySQL events are similar to cron jobs; they allow scheduling database actions at specific intervals or times. You can create events from Python using SQL commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# SQL query to create an event\n",
    "create_event_query = \"\"\"\n",
    "CREATE EVENT my_event\n",
    "ON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 DAY\n",
    "DO\n",
    "  INSERT INTO your_table_name (column1, column2)\n",
    "  VALUES ('event_value', 123);\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Execute the event creation query\n",
    "cursor.execute(create_event_query)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Commit the transaction\n",
    "connection.commit()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Handling Transactions**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to manage transactions explicitly, you can do so by using `connection.commit()` and `connection.rollback()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Example insert query\n",
    "    insert_query = \"INSERT INTO your_table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (%s, %s)\"\n",
    "    data = ('value', 123)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Execute query\n",
    "    cursor.execute(insert_query)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Commit the transaction\n",
    "    connection.commit()\n",
    "    print(\"Transaction committed successfully.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "except mysql.connector.Error as error:\n",
    "    # Rollback in case of error\n",
    "    connection.rollback()\n",
    "    print(f\"Transaction failed, rolled back. Error: {error}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Working with Prepared Statements**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use prepared statements to improve the performance of executing multiple similar SQL statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example prepared statement for inserting data\n",
    "insert_query = \"INSERT INTO your_table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (%s, %s)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Prepare the statement\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"PREPARE stmt FROM %s\", (insert_query,))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data for multiple inserts\n",
    "data = [('value1', 123), ('value2', 456), ('value3', 789)]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Execute prepared statement with different data\n",
    "for item in data:\n",
    "    cursor.execute(\"EXECUTE stmt USING %s, %s\", item)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Commit the transaction\n",
    "connection.commit()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Deallocate the prepared statement\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Triggers and Events via Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you define triggers and events, they execute automatically based on database actions or schedules. However, you can create or drop these using Python by executing SQL commands, as shown in the examples above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Update and Delete**: You can use `UPDATE` and `DELETE` SQL queries in the same way you use `INSERT`, with parameterized queries.\n",
    "- **Stored Procedures and Functions**: You can execute stored procedures with `callproc()` and stored functions with `SELECT`.\n",
    "- **Triggers and Events**: While triggers and events are managed in MySQL itself, you can create them using SQL queries executed from Python.\n",
    "- **Transactions**: You can manage transactions explicitly with `commit()` and `rollback()`.\n",
    "- **Prepared Statements**: You can use prepared statements for efficient execution of multiple similar queries.\n",

    "## C. Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "when calling a MySQL stored procedure that has output parameters, you will need to declare and use **user-defined session variables** (e.g., `@output`) in your Python code to capture the output values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can work with stored procedures that return output parameters using `mysql.connector` in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Setup: Stored Procedure with Output Parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let’s assume you have a stored procedure in MySQL like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DELIMITER //\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE PROCEDURE GetUserBalance(\n",
    "    IN user_id INT,\n",
    "    OUT user_balance DECIMAL(10,2)\n",
    ")\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    SELECT balance INTO user_balance\n",
    "    FROM users\n",
    "    WHERE id = user_id;\n",
    "END //\n",
    "\n",
    "DELIMITER ;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `user_balance` is the **output parameter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Guide for Calling the Stored Procedure with Output Parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Connect to MySQL in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "First, establish a connection to your MySQL database using `mysql.connector`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mysql.connector\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establish connection to MySQL\n",
    "connection = mysql.connector.connect(\n",
    "    host='localhost',\n",
    "    user='your_username',\n",
    "    password='your_password',\n",
    "    database='your_database'\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a cursor object\n",
    "cursor = connection.cursor()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Declare the Output Variable in MySQL\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to declare a session variable (e.g., `@output`) to hold the result of the output parameter. You can do this directly via a query in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Declare the session variable in MySQL\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"SET @user_balance = 0;\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Call the Stored Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then call the stored procedure, passing the input parameter and using the session variable for the output parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Call the stored procedure with input and output parameters\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"CALL GetUserBalance(%s, @user_balance);\", (1,))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `1` is the `user_id` passed as the input parameter, and `@user_balance` is the output parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Retrieve the Output Value\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, retrieve the value of the output parameter using a `SELECT` query to fetch the value of the session variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Fetch the output value\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"SELECT @user_balance;\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the result\n",
    "user_balance = cursor.fetchone()[0]\n",
    "print(f\"User balance: {user_balance}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Close the Cursor and Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're done, make sure to close the cursor and connection:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cursor.close()\n",
    "connection.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full Python Example\n",

    "Here’s how you can call this stored procedure directly using `cursor.callproc()` in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Connect to MySQL in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "First, establish a connection to your MySQL database using `mysql.connector`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mysql.connector\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establish connection to MySQL\n",
    "connection = mysql.connector.connect(\n",
    "    host='localhost',\n",
    "    user='your_username',\n",
    "    password='your_password',\n",
    "    database='your_database'\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a cursor object\n",
    "cursor = connection.cursor()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Call the Stored Procedure Using `callproc()`\n",
    "\n",
    "When using `callproc()`, you can pass both input and output parameters as arguments. For the output parameters, you need to pass a placeholder value (e.g., `0`) or `None`, and the function will return the modified values as a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Call the stored procedure\n",
    "result = cursor.callproc('GetUserBalance', [1, 0])  # 1 is the user_id (input), 0 is a placeholder for the output\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output is now stored in result[1]\n",
    "print(f\"User balance: {result[1]}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Fetch the Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The `callproc()` method returns a list (or tuple) containing the values of all parameters (both input and output) after the procedure execution. In this example, `result[1]` will hold the value of the `user_balance` output parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Close the Cursor and Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "After executing the stored procedure and fetching the output, always remember to close the cursor and connection:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cursor.close()\n",
    "connection.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full Python Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the complete Python code that integrates all the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mysql.connector\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Establish connection to MySQL\n",
    "    connection = mysql.connector.connect(\n",
    "        host='localhost',\n",
    "        user='your_username',\n",
    "        password='your_password',\n",
    "        database='your_database'\n",
    "    )\n",
    "\n",
    "    cursor = connection.cursor()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Call the stored procedure with input (1) and output (placeholder 0)\n",
    "    result = cursor.callproc('GetUserBalance', [1, 0])\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Fetch the output parameter (user_balance)\n",
    "    user_balance = result[1]  # This is where the output value is stored\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(f\"User balance: {user_balance}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "except mysql.connector.Error as e:\n",

    "        cursor.close()\n",
    "        connection.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of `callproc()`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`callproc(procedure_name, params)`**: \n",
    "  - **`procedure_name`**: The name of the stored procedure (`GetUserBalance` in this case).\n",
    "  - **`params`**: A list of input and output parameters. The input parameters are passed as normal, while output parameters are passed as placeholder values (e.g., `0` or `None`).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  After execution, `callproc()` returns a tuple with the input parameters unchanged and the output parameters filled with their resulting values from the stored procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Parameters**: Provide the input values directly in the list (e.g., `1` for `user_id`).\n",
    "2. **Output Parameters**: For output parameters, use a placeholder value (e.g., `0` or `None`).\n",
    "3. **Result**: After calling the procedure, the list returned by `callproc()` will contain the output values. In this example, `result[1]` contains the output `user_balance`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use `cursor.callproc()`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Best suited for calling stored procedures** with a combination of input and output parameters.\n",
    "- **Simplifies interaction** with procedures by returning output parameters directly after the call without needing session variables.\n",

    "it is recommended to always close the **cursor** before closing the **connection** when you're done with your database operations. This ensures that all the resources used by the cursor are released properly before the connection is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Should You Close the Cursor Before the Connection?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Resource Management**: The cursor object uses memory and other resources. Closing the cursor ensures that these resources are released properly before the connection is closed.\n",
    "   \n",

Explicitly closing the cursor is considered a clean and reliable way to handle resources.\n",

    "In MySQL with `mysql.connector` (and other similar database connectors), understanding when to use `execute()` and `commit()` is important for correctly handling database transactions. Here's a breakdown of each and when to use them:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **`cursor.execute()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: This is used to execute SQL queries (such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, etc.) against the database.\n",
    "- **Usage**: You use `execute()` when you want to run a query or command on the database.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### When to Use `execute()`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SELECT Queries**: When fetching data from the database:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM your_table\")\n",
    "  result = cursor.fetchall()  # Or fetchone() for single row\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE Queries**: When modifying the data in the database (these changes are only reflected after `commit()`):\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  cursor.execute(\"INSERT INTO your_table (column1, column2) VALUES (%s, %s)\", (value1, value2))\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DDL (Data Definition Language) Queries**: When modifying the structure of the database (e.g., creating tables or indices):\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  cursor.execute(\"CREATE TABLE my_table (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(50))\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **`connection.commit()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: `commit()` is used to save the changes you made in the database during the current transaction. Without committing, changes (like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`) will not be permanently applied to the database.\n",
    "- **Usage**: After using `execute()` to modify data (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`), you must call `commit()` to save the changes to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Use `commit()`\n",
    "\n",

    "      connection.rollback()\n",
    "      print(\"Transaction failed, rolled back:\", error)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When Not to Use `commit()`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For `SELECT` Queries**: You don’t need to call `commit()` for `SELECT` queries because no changes are made to the data in the database.\n",

    "  cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM your_table\")\n",
    "  result = cursor.fetchall()\n",
    "  # No need for commit()\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **`connection.rollback()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: This is used to undo any changes made in the current transaction if an error occurs. It effectively \"rolls back\" the database to the state before the transaction started.\n",
    "- **Usage**: You use `rollback()` if an exception occurs and you want to ensure that partial changes are not saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Use `rollback()`\n",

    "The need to use `commit()` when calling **stored functions**, **stored procedures**, **triggers**, or **events** depends on what the function, procedure, trigger, or event is doing:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Calling Stored Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No `commit()` Needed**: \n",
    "  - Stored functions are typically used to return a value (like a calculation or a result based on inputs). They don't usually modify the data in the database (i.e., they are read-only).\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. **Calling Stored Procedures**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Depends on the Procedure**:\n",
    "  - If the stored procedure **modifies data** (e.g., it performs an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operation), you **need to call `commit()`** after executing it.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **No `commit()` Needed Directly for Triggers**:\n",
    "  - Triggers are **automatically executed** in response to certain actions (like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`). The execution of a trigger is tied to the statement that caused it.\n",

    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Events**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No `commit()` Needed Directly for Events**:\n",
    "  - MySQL events are **scheduled tasks** (similar to cron jobs) that are executed at predefined intervals or times. When the event runs, it can execute queries that modify the database.\n",
    "  - Since events run automatically and independently of your Python code, you don't need to call `commit()` in your code for events.\n",
    "  - However, if you're executing queries that modify the database as part of an event in your code, you **need to call `commit()`** after executing those queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Creating an Event\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE EVENT UpdateDailyBalances\n",
    "ON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 DAY\n",
    "DO\n",
    "  UPDATE users SET balance = balance * 1.01 WHERE account_type = 'savings';\n",

    "  connection.commit()  # Commit to ensure the event creation is saved\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Stored Procedures with Transactions**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are working with stored procedures that handle transactions inside the procedure itself (e.g., they contain `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, or `ROLLBACK` statements), you might not need to call `commit()` externally in Python because the stored procedure manages the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the stored procedure does not handle the transaction and you call it from Python, you still need to call `commit()` after the procedure to save the changes.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Stored Functions**: No `commit()` is needed unless the function modifies data (which is unusual for a function).\n",

    "- **Any action that modifies the data, structure, or schema in the database (such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, etc.) requires a `commit()`** to make the changes permanent in the database.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Without `commit()`, any changes made will not be saved, and if the connection is closed, those changes will be **rolled back** (i.e., undone).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Actions that **require** `commit()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Modifications**:\n",
    "   - `INSERT`\n",
    "   - `UPDATE`\n",
    "   - `DELETE`\n",
    "   - `REPLACE`\n",
    "   - Bulk data modifications or manipulations\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Schema or Structure Changes**:\n",
    "   - `CREATE TABLE`\n",
    "   - `ALTER TABLE`\n",
    "   - `DROP TABLE`\n",
    "   - `CREATE INDEX`\n",
    "   - `DROP INDEX`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Stored Procedures**:\n",
    "   - If the stored procedure makes changes to the database (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`), you need to call `commit()` after executing the procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Triggers**:\n",
    "   - While triggers are automatically invoked by other actions (like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, etc.), the **action that triggers the trigger** will require a `commit()` to save the changes, including those made by the trigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Events**:\n",
    "   - If you modify the database as part of creating or altering an event (e.g., using `CREATE EVENT`), you'll need to call `commit()` to save the event creation or alteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Actions that **do not require** `commit()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Read-Only Queries**:\n",
    "   - `SELECT` statements do not modify data, so they do not require `commit()`.\n",
    "   - You can fetch and read data without needing to commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Stored Functions**:\n",
    "   - Stored functions that only **return values** (like a calculation or result) and do not modify data do not require `commit()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Stored Procedures**:\n",
    "   - If a stored procedure is purely for fetching or reading data (without modifying it), you don't need to call `commit()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Point\n",
    "\n",
    "**If the action affects the state of the database by modifying data, tables, or schema**, you need to call `commit()` to make the changes permanent.\n",

    "## F. Replace and Insert Clauses\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `REPLACE` statement in MySQL is a combination of `INSERT` and `DELETE`. It attempts to insert a row into a table, but if a row with the same primary key or unique index already exists, it will delete the existing row and insert the new one. This is helpful when you want to ensure a unique row is replaced or updated without having to manually check for its existence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "REPLACE INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3)\n",
    "VALUES (value1, value2, value3);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Table\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a table `employees` with the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "    position VARCHAR(100)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Using `REPLACE` to Insert a New Row\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is no existing row with the same `id`, the `REPLACE` statement behaves like `INSERT`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "REPLACE INTO employees (id, name, position)\n",
    "VALUES (1, 'Alice', 'Manager');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Result**: Since there is no row with `id = 1`, a new row is inserted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Using `REPLACE` to Update a Row\n",
    "\n",
    "If a row already exists with the same `id` or unique key, `REPLACE` will first delete the existing row and then insert the new row.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "REPLACE INTO employees (id, name, position)\n",
    "VALUES (1, 'Alice', 'Director');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Result**: The existing row with `id = 1` will be deleted, and a new row with `id = 1` will be inserted. The row is now updated with `position = 'Director'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3: Using `REPLACE` with Multiple Rows\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also replace multiple rows at once by specifying multiple sets of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "REPLACE INTO employees (id, name, position)\n",
    "VALUES (2, 'Bob', 'Engineer'), (3, 'Carol', 'Analyst');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Result**: \n",
    "  - If no rows exist with `id = 2` or `id = 3`, both rows are inserted.\n",
    "  - If rows with `id = 2` or `id = 3` already exist, they are deleted and replaced with the new values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 4: Using `REPLACE` to Avoid Duplicates Based on Unique Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "If your table has a unique key (other than the primary key), `REPLACE` can be used to ensure that duplicates based on the unique key are avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the `employees` table also has a unique index on the `name` column:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_name ON employees (name);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if you try to `REPLACE` an employee with the same name, the existing row will be replaced:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "REPLACE INTO employees (id, name, position)\n",
    "VALUES (4, 'Alice', 'CEO');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Result**: Even though `id = 4` is new, the row with `name = 'Alice'` will be deleted (because `name` is unique), and a new row with `id = 4` and `name = 'Alice'` will be inserted with the updated position (`CEO`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 5: `REPLACE` with `SELECT`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use `REPLACE` in combination with a `SELECT` statement to insert or update rows dynamically based on data from another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "REPLACE INTO employees (id, name, position)\n",
    "SELECT id, name, position FROM new_employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Result**: Rows from `new_employees` will be inserted into `employees`. If any conflicts occur based on the primary key or unique indexes, the existing rows will be replaced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points to Remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Deletes and Inserts**: `REPLACE` first deletes the existing row if there's a conflict on a primary key or unique key, and then inserts the new row.\n",
    "2. **Auto-Increment Columns**: If you're using an auto-increment column, `REPLACE` will create a new auto-increment value, even if an old row is being replaced. This can lead to gaps in your auto-increment sequence.\n",
    "3. **Not a Full Update**: `REPLACE` is not the same as `UPDATE`. It fully replaces the row, meaning that any columns not specified will be set to their default values.\n",
