    " ## A. `Triggers `\n",
    "\n",
    "A **trigger** in MySQL is a special type of `stored program` that automatically executes or \"fires\" in response to certain events on a particular table. Triggers are useful for enforcing business rules, maintaining data integrity, auditing changes, and performing automated actions in the database without requiring additional application logic.\n",

    "## Types of Triggers\n",
    "\n",
    "In MySQL, triggers are classified based on the timing and the event that activates them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Timing:**\n",
    "   - **BEFORE:** The trigger executes before the triggering event (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) occurs.\n",
    "   - **AFTER:** The trigger executes after the triggering event occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Event:**\n",
    "   - **INSERT:** Fired when a new row is inserted into a table.\n",
    "   - **UPDATE:** Fired when an existing row is updated.\n",
    "   - **DELETE:** Fired when a row is deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining these, you can have up to six types of triggers for each table:\n",
    "\n",
    "- BEFORE INSERT\n",
    "- AFTER INSERT\n",
    "- BEFORE UPDATE\n",
    "- AFTER UPDATE\n",
    "- BEFORE DELETE\n",
    "- AFTER DELETE\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** MySQL does not support triggers for `SELECT` statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Triggers\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a trigger in MySQL, you use the `CREATE TRIGGER` statement. You must specify:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trigger Name:** A unique name for the trigger.\n",
    "- **Timing:** BEFORE or AFTER.\n",
    "- **Event:** INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.\n",
    "- **Table:** The table to which the trigger is associated.\n",
    "- **Body:** The SQL statements that define what the trigger does.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Privileges:** You need the `CREATE TRIGGER` privilege for the database.\n",
    "- **One Trigger per Event per Timing:** MySQL allows only one trigger per combination of timing and event per table.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trigger Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name\n",
    "    {BEFORE | AFTER} {INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE}\n",
    "    ON table_name\n",
    "    FOR EACH ROW\n",
    "    BEGIN\n",
    "        -- Trigger logic here\n",
    "    END;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **trigger_name:** Name of the trigger. It must be unique within the database.\n",
    "- **BEFORE | AFTER:** Specifies when the trigger should execute relative to the triggering event.\n",
    "- **INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE:** The event that activates the trigger.\n",
    "- **table_name:** The table the trigger is associated with.\n",
    "- **FOR EACH ROW:** Indicates that the trigger will execute for each row affected by the event.\n",
    "- **Trigger Logic:** The SQL statements to execute when the trigger fires. You can access the old and new values using `OLD` and `NEW` qualifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TRIGGER before_employee_insert\n",
    "    BEFORE INSERT\n",
    "    ON employees\n",
    "    FOR EACH ROW\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    -- Example logic: Ensure the salary is not negative\n",
    "    IF NEW.salary < 0 THEN\n",
    "        SET NEW.salary = 0;\n",
    "    END IF;\n",
    "END;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: BEFORE INSERT Trigger\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** Automatically set the `created_at` timestamp before inserting a new row.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE users (\n",
    "    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Trigger Name:** `before_user_insert`\n",
    "- **Timing:** BEFORE INSERT\n",
    "- **Table:** `users`\n",
    "- **Logic:** If the `created_at` field is not provided (`NULL`), set it to the current timestamp using `NOW()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: AFTER UPDATE Trigger\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** Maintain an audit log whenever a user's information is updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE user_audit (\n",
    "    audit_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Trigger Name:** `after_user_update`\n",
    "- **Timing:** AFTER UPDATE\n",
    "- **Table:** `users`\n",
    "- **Logic:** Inserts a new record into the `user_audit` table capturing the old and new `username`, the time of change, and the user who made the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3: BEFORE DELETE Trigger\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** Prevent deletion of users who are marked as administrators.\n",

    "    END IF;\n",
    "END$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Trigger Name:** `before_user_delete`\n",
    "- **Timing:** BEFORE DELETE\n",
    "- **Table:** `users`\n",
    "- **Logic:** Checks if the user to be deleted has the role 'admin'. If so, it aborts the deletion and raises an error using the `SIGNAL` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Managing Triggers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Viewing Existing Triggers\n",
    "\n",
    "To list all triggers in the current database:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SHOW TRIGGERS;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command displays information such as the trigger name, associated table, event, timing, and the trigger's body.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dropping a Trigger\n",
    "\n",
    "To remove a trigger, use the `DROP TRIGGER` statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DROP TRIGGER [IF EXISTS] trigger_name;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS before_user_insert;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Dropping a trigger requires the `DROP` privilege for triggers on the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use Triggers Sparingly:** While triggers are powerful, overusing them can make the database logic complex and harder to maintain. Consider if application-level logic could achieve the same result more transparently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Keep Trigger Logic Simple:** Complex logic can lead to performance issues and make debugging difficult. Aim for clarity and simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Document Triggers:** Clearly document the purpose and behavior of each trigger to aid future maintenance and understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Avoid Side Effects:** Triggers should not perform actions that lead to unexpected side effects, such as modifying unrelated tables excessively or causing recursive trigger calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Handle Exceptions Gracefully:** Use proper error handling within triggers to prevent unwanted disruptions during data operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Test Thoroughly:** Ensure triggers behave as expected under various scenarios to avoid data inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **One Trigger per Event per Timing per Table:** MySQL allows only one trigger for each combination of timing (BEFORE/AFTER) and event (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) per table. To perform multiple actions for the same event, combine them within a single trigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **No Native Support for INSTEAD OF Triggers:** Unlike some other database systems (e.g., SQL Server), MySQL does not support `INSTEAD OF` triggers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Performance Impact:** Triggers add overhead to data modification operations. Excessive or inefficient triggers can degrade performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Recursion and Nested Triggers:** MySQL does not support recursive triggers, meaning a trigger cannot directly or indirectly cause itself to execute again.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Limited Transaction Control:** Triggers execute within the transaction of the triggering statement. You cannot commit or roll back transactions within a trigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Error Handling:** If a trigger encounters an error, it can cause the entire operation (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) to fail. Proper error handling is essential to avoid unintended data issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Access to OLD and NEW:** \n",
    "   - **INSERT Triggers:** Only `NEW` is available.\n",
    "   - **DELETE Triggers:** Only `OLD` is available.\n",
    "   - **UPDATE Triggers:** Both `OLD` and `NEW` are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Difference Between Triggers and Stored Procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "While both triggers and stored procedures are types of stored programs in MySQL, they serve different purposes and have distinct behaviors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Invocation:**\n",
    "  - **Triggers:** Automatically execute in response to specific table events (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).\n",
    "  - **Stored Procedures:** Manually invoked by the user or application via the `CALL` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Usage:**\n",
    "  - **Triggers:** Used for automatic enforcement of rules, auditing, and maintaining data integrity.\n",
    "  - **Stored Procedures:** Used to encapsulate reusable logic, perform complex operations, and support modular programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameters:**\n",
    "  - **Triggers:** Do not accept parameters; they operate based on the triggering event's context.\n",
    "  - **Stored Procedures:** Can accept input, output, and input/output parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Control Flow:**\n",
    "  - **Triggers:** Execute as part of the transaction that triggered them.\n",
    "  - **Stored Procedures:** Execute independently, though they can be part of transactions initiated by the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding when to use triggers versus stored procedures is crucial for designing efficient and maintainable database systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Triggers in MySQL are powerful tools for automating database operations and enforcing business rules at the database level. They can help maintain data integrity, perform auditing, and automate repetitive tasks without requiring changes to application code. However, it's essential to use them judiciously, keeping their logic as simple as possible, to avoid complexity and potential performance issues. Proper documentation and adherence to best practices will ensure that triggers contribute positively to your database design and application functionality."

    "## B. `OLD` and `NEW` keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "In SQL triggers, the `OLD` and `NEW` keywords are used to reference the values of a row before and after a triggering event.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`OLD`**: Refers to the value of a column before an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` operation.\n",
    "- **`NEW`**: Refers to the value of a column after an `INSERT` or `UPDATE` operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use `OLD`:\n",
    "- Use `OLD` to refer to the values that existed before the update or delete operation.\n",
    "- It is primarily used in `AFTER UPDATE`, `BEFORE UPDATE`, and `BEFORE DELETE` triggers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use `NEW`:\n",
    "- Use `NEW` to refer to the values that are being inserted or updated after the triggering event.\n",
    "- It is used in `AFTER INSERT`, `BEFORE INSERT`, and `AFTER UPDATE` triggers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In your trigger example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you're logging the old and new usernames when a user record is updated:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`OLD.username`**: Refers to the username before it was updated.\n",
    "- **`NEW.username`**: Refers to the username after it was updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, for an `AFTER UPDATE` trigger:\n",
    "- **Use `OLD`** to capture the previous value of the username.\n",
    "- **Use `NEW`** to capture the new value after the update has occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "This logic ensures that the audit log captures the username change history by storing both the old and new usernames.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trigger Summary:\n",
    "- **`OLD.id`**: References the user’s ID before the update.\n",
    "- **`NEW.username`**: References the new username after the update.\n",
    "- **`OLD.username`**: Captures the old username before the update.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your `user_audit` trigger, this is used correctly to track changes to usernames."

    " `OLD` and `NEW` are part of the SQL trigger **syntax**. They are special keywords used in triggers to refer to the values of the row before and after a modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how they work in terms of syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`OLD`**: Refers to the existing values of a row before an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` operation. It is valid only in `UPDATE` and `DELETE` triggers.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **`NEW`**: Refers to the new values that will be applied to a row during an `INSERT` or `UPDATE` operation. It is valid in `INSERT` and `UPDATE` triggers.\n",

    "### Where `OLD` and `NEW` are part of the syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`AFTER UPDATE` or `BEFORE UPDATE` Triggers**:\n",
    "   - Both `OLD` and `NEW` can be used to reference values before and after the update.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **`AFTER DELETE` or `BEFORE DELETE` Triggers**:\n",
    "   - Only `OLD` is available, as the row is being deleted and there are no \"new\" values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`AFTER INSERT` or `BEFORE INSERT` Triggers**:\n",
    "   - Only `NEW` is available, as there are no \"old\" values for a new row.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Syntax with `OLD` and `NEW`:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Update Trigger** (using both `OLD` and `NEW`):\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TRIGGER after_user_update\n",
    "AFTER UPDATE ON users\n",
    "FOR EACH ROW\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    INSERT INTO user_audit (user_id, old_username, new_username)\n",
    "    VALUES (OLD.id, OLD.username, NEW.username);  -- `OLD` and `NEW` are part of syntax here\n",
    "END;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Delete Trigger** (only using `OLD`):\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TRIGGER after_user_delete\n",
    "AFTER DELETE ON users\n",
    "FOR EACH ROW\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    INSERT INTO user_audit (user_id, old_username)\n",
    "    VALUES (OLD.id, OLD.username);  -- only `OLD` is available\n",

    "CREATE TRIGGER after_user_insert\n",
    "AFTER INSERT ON users\n",
    "FOR EACH ROW\n",
    "BEGIN\n",

    "    VALUES (NEW.id, NEW.username);  -- only `NEW` is available\n",
    "END;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "`OLD` and `NEW` are **mandatory** syntax elements when you need to refer to the old or new values of a row in a trigger. They are part of how SQL triggers handle row-level operations and cannot be changed. If you don't need to refer to row values, you can omit them, but when row data is involved, `OLD` and `NEW` are essential syntax elements."

    "## C. `BEFORE` and `AFTER` triggers \n",
    "\n",
    "In MySQL, `BEFORE` and `AFTER` triggers are used to define actions that occur automatically in response to `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` events on a table. The difference between `BEFORE` and `AFTER` lies in when the trigger executes relative to the event:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **BEFORE Triggers**:\n",
    "- **Execution Timing**: `BEFORE` triggers are executed before the specified event (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`) happens.\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Use `BEFORE` triggers when you need to validate or modify the data before the event occurs.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   Common scenarios:\n",
    "   - **Validating data**: Ensure the data is in the correct format or meets certain conditions before it is inserted or updated.\n",
    "   - **Setting default values**: Automatically adjust or set certain field values before insertion or updating.\n",
    "   - **Preventing an operation**: You can signal an error (using `SIGNAL`) if certain conditions aren't met, effectively preventing the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example of a `BEFORE INSERT` trigger:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TRIGGER before_insert_users\n",
    "   BEFORE INSERT ON users\n",
    "   FOR EACH ROW\n",

    "     END IF;\n",
    "   END;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **AFTER Triggers**:\n",
    "- **Execution Timing**: `AFTER` triggers are executed after the specified event (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`) has occurred.\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Use `AFTER` triggers when you need to perform actions based on the result of the event.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   Common scenarios:\n",
    "   - **Logging changes**: You can use `AFTER` triggers to log changes to another table (such as keeping an audit trail of operations).\n",
    "   - **Cascading actions**: Perform additional actions that depend on the completion of the insert, update, or delete (e.g., updating another table or sending a notification).\n",
    "   - **Enforcing integrity**: Apply changes to other tables after an operation is successfully completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example of an `AFTER INSERT` trigger:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TRIGGER after_insert_users\n",
    "   AFTER INSERT ON users\n",
    "   FOR EACH ROW\n",
    "   BEGIN\n",
    "     INSERT INTO user_logs (user_id, action, timestamp)\n",
    "     VALUES (NEW.id, 'INSERT', NOW());\n",
    "   END;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of When to Use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BEFORE Triggers**: \n",
    "  - Modify or validate the data **before** it is inserted, updated, or deleted.\n",
    "  - Prevent the event by signaling an error if needed.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **AFTER Triggers**: \n",
    "  - Perform actions **after** the event has occurred.\n",
    "  - Useful for logging, sending notifications, or making related changes after the main event.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, triggers can be useful for maintaining data integrity, automating repetitive tasks, or enforcing business rules."
