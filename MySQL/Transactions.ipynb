    "## Transaction: \n",
    "\n",
    "In MySQL, transactions allow you to execute a set of SQL queries as a single unit of work. If any query fails, you can roll back all the changes made by previous queries in the transaction. If all queries are successful, you can commit the changes, making them permanent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "1. **START TRANSACTION**: Begins a new transaction.\n",
    "2. **COMMIT**: Saves the changes made in the transaction.\n",
    "3. **ROLLBACK**: Undoes the changes made in the transaction if something goes wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Using Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume we have two tables: `accounts` and `transactions`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE accounts (\n",
    "    account_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    balance DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE transactions (\n",
    "    transaction_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    from_account INT,\n",
    "    to_account INT,\n",
    "    amount DECIMAL(10, 2),\n",
    "    timestamp DATETIME\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Simple Transaction for Transferring Money Between Two Accounts\n",
    "\n",
    "This example transfers $100 from account 1 to account 2. If any part of the transaction fails (e.g., insufficient balance), the whole transaction is rolled back.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Start the transaction\n",
    "START TRANSACTION;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Check if the source account has enough balance\n",
    "SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE account_id = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Assuming account 1 has enough balance, deduct $100 from account 1\n",
    "UPDATE accounts\n",
    "SET balance = balance - 100\n",
    "WHERE account_id = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Add $100 to account 2\n",
    "UPDATE accounts\n",
    "SET balance = balance + 100\n",
    "WHERE account_id = 2;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Insert the transaction record\n",
    "INSERT INTO transactions (from_account, to_account, amount, timestamp)\n",
    "VALUES (1, 2, 100, NOW());\n",
    "\n",
    "-- If all queries succeed, commit the transaction\n",
    "COMMIT;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If something goes wrong during the transaction, you can call `ROLLBACK` instead of `COMMIT`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Roll back the transaction if an error occurs\n",
    "ROLLBACK;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Handling Errors in Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to handle the case where account 1 doesn't have enough balance. We can add a conditional check:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Start the transaction\n",
    "START TRANSACTION;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Check the balance of account 1\n",
    "SELECT balance INTO @balance FROM accounts WHERE account_id = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- If the balance is sufficient, proceed with the transfer\n",
    "IF @balance >= 100 THEN\n",
    "    -- Deduct $100 from account 1\n",
    "    UPDATE accounts\n",
    "    SET balance = balance - 100\n",
    "    WHERE account_id = 1;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -- Add $100 to account 2\n",
    "    UPDATE accounts\n",
    "    SET balance = balance + 100\n",
    "    WHERE account_id = 2;\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Record the transaction\n",
    "    INSERT INTO transactions (from_account, to_account, amount, timestamp)\n",
    "    VALUES (1, 2, 100, NOW());\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -- Commit the changes\n",
    "    COMMIT;\n",
    "ELSE\n",
    "    -- If there isn't enough balance, roll back the changes\n",
    "    ROLLBACK;\n",
    "END IF;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This example ensures that if account 1 doesn't have enough balance, the transaction is rolled back.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3: Using `SAVEPOINT`\n",
    "\n",
    "A savepoint allows you to roll back part of a transaction without rolling back the entire transaction. Here’s how to use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Start the transaction\n",
    "START TRANSACTION;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Set a savepoint\n",
    "SAVEPOINT before_transfer;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Try to deduct $100 from account 1\n",
    "UPDATE accounts\n",
    "SET balance = balance - 100\n",
    "WHERE account_id = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Check if the deduction was successful (imagine some condition here)\n",
    "-- If not successful, rollback to the savepoint\n",
    "ROLLBACK TO before_transfer;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- If all goes well, commit the changes\n",
    "COMMIT;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With `SAVEPOINT`, you can roll back to specific stages within the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples show how transactions can be useful for ensuring data integrity when working with multiple related queries."

    "### Remarks: \n",
    "\n",
    "In MySQL, you don't need to explicitly declare user-defined variables like `@balance` before using them. MySQL automatically initializes a variable when you first assign a value to it using the `SELECT INTO` syntax or through direct assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Example 2 (`Handling Errors in Transactions`), when you run this query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT balance INTO @balance FROM accounts WHERE account_id = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "MySQL will create the `@balance` variable and assign it the value from the `balance` column for `account_id = 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Points to Remember:\n",
    "- User-defined variables (those starting with `@`) are session-specific and exist as long as the session is active.\n",
    "- You don't need to declare or specify their data type.\n",
    "- If no rows match the `SELECT` query, `@balance` will be set to `NULL`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in your case, there is no need to declare `@balance` before using it. MySQL handles it automatically when you assign a value to it with `SELECT INTO`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example with Error Handling\n",

    "\n",
    "    -- Check if the balance is sufficient\n",
    "    IF @balance >= 100 THEN\n",

    "        UPDATE accounts\n",
    "        SET balance = balance - 100\n",
    "        WHERE account_id = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "        -- Add $100 to account 2\n",
    "        UPDATE accounts\n",
    "        SET balance = balance + 100\n",
    "        WHERE account_id = 2;\n",
    "\n",

    "        INSERT INTO transactions (from_account, to_account, amount, timestamp)\n",
    "        VALUES (1, 2, 100, NOW());\n",
    "\n",
    "        -- Optionally, delete some temporary data (example)\n",
    "        DELETE FROM temp_transactions WHERE account_id = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "        -- Commit the transaction\n",
    "        COMMIT;\n",
