    "### Stored Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** Stored functions are routines that accept parameters, perform operations, and return a single value.\n",
    "- **Usage:** They can be used in SQL statements anywhere an expression of their return type is allowed, such as in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, or `HAVING` clauses.\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  CREATE FUNCTION CalculateTax(subtotal DECIMAL(10,2))\n",
    "  RETURNS DECIMAL(10,2)\n",
    "  DETERMINISTIC\n",
    "  BEGIN\n",
    "      RETURN subtotal * 0.07; -- 7% tax\n",
    "  END;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stored Procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** Stored procedures are routines that perform actions, which may include multiple SQL statements, and may or may not return values.\n",
    "- **Usage:** They are invoked using the `CALL` statement and can perform operations like inserting, updating, or deleting data.\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  CREATE PROCEDURE AddEmployee(IN name VARCHAR(100), IN salary DECIMAL(10,2))\n",
    "  BEGIN\n",
    "      INSERT INTO Employees (name, salary) VALUES (name, salary);\n",

    "\n",
    "### Within a Stored Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "You can call a stored function directly within a stored procedure by using it in SQL statements or by assigning its return value to a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Within Another Stored Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, you can call one stored function within another stored function, provided that the called function does not perform operations that are disallowed within stored functions (like modifying data).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through some practical examples to illustrate how to call stored functions within other functions and procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Simple Function Call within a Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Create a stored function to calculate tax and a stored procedure that uses this function to compute the total amount after tax.\n",

    "END;\n",
    "//\n",
    "\n",
    "DELIMITER ;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Using the Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Declare a variable to hold the total\n",
    "SET @subtotal = 100.00;\n",

    "\n",
    "| TotalAfterTax |\n",
    "|---------------|\n",
    "| 107.00        |\n",

    "### Example 2: Function Calling Another Function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Create two stored functions where one calls the other to perform a composite calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Create the `CalculateTax` Function (Same as Above)\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",

    "END;\n",
    "//\n",
    "\n",
    "DELIMITER ;\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Modular Design:**\n",
    "   - **Reusability:** Break down complex logic into smaller, reusable functions.\n",
    "   - **Maintainability:** Easier to manage and update individual components without affecting others.\n",
    "\n",

    "   - Clearly name your functions and procedures to reflect their purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handle Exceptions:**\n",
    "   - Implement error handling within your functions and procedures to manage unexpected scenarios gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Minimize Side Effects in Functions:**\n",
    "   - Stored functions should primarily perform computations and return values without modifying database state. Avoid using functions to perform `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Document Your Code:**\n",
    "   - Comment your stored functions and procedures to explain their functionality, parameters, and return values.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Optimize for Performance:**\n",
    "   - Be mindful of the performance implications of nested function calls, especially within large datasets or complex queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Use Deterministic Functions When Possible:**\n",
    "   - Declare functions as `DETERMINISTIC` or `NOT DETERMINISTIC` appropriately to help the optimizer and caching mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Considerations and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "While calling stored functions within other functions or procedures is straightforward, there are several important considerations and potential limitations to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Data Modification Restrictions in Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stored Functions:** In MySQL, stored functions have limitations compared to stored procedures. Specifically, they **cannot** perform operations that modify data, such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  **Allowed Operations:**\n",
    "  - Variable declarations\n",
    "  - Conditional logic (`IF`, `CASE`)\n",
    "  - Loops (`WHILE`, `REPEAT`)\n",
    "  - Reading data via `SELECT` (without modifying it)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  **Disallowed Operations:**\n",
    "  - Modifying tables (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`)\n",
    "  - Transaction control statements (`COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`)\n",
    "  - Dynamic SQL using `PREPARE` and `EXECUTE`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stored Procedures:** Unlike functions, stored procedures can perform data modification operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Determinism**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deterministic Functions:** Always return the same result given the same input parameters.\n",
    "- **Non-Deterministic Functions:** May return different results for the same input parameters (e.g., functions that use `RAND()` or access volatile system data).\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Impact:** The `DETERMINISTIC` or `NOT DETERMINISTIC` declaration affects optimization and caching. Ensure accurate declarations to maintain performance and correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Security and Permissions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Execution Rights:** Ensure that the user executing the procedure or function has the necessary permissions to execute the called functions.\n",
    "- **Definer vs. Invoker:** Understand the execution context (whether functions are executed with the privileges of their definer or invoker) to manage security appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Error Handling**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Propagation of Errors:** Errors in called functions can propagate to the calling procedure or function. Implement proper error handling to manage such scenarios.\n",
    "- **Use of `DECLARE ... HANDLER`:** Utilize error handlers within stored procedures to manage exceptions gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Performance Implications**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nested Calls:** Excessive nesting of function calls can lead to performance degradation, especially with large datasets or complex logic.\n",
    "- **Optimization:** Optimize individual functions for performance and avoid unnecessary computations within nested calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Recursion Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recursion Support:** MySQL allows stored functions to be recursive (a function calling itself), but it has limitations on the depth of recursion to prevent stack overflows.\n",
    "- **Caution:** Use recursion judiciously and consider iterative approaches when possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Transaction Management**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stored Functions:** Should not manage transactions (e.g., `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) as they are designed to be side-effect-free.\n",
    "- **Stored Procedures:** Can manage transactions, but be cautious when they are called from other procedures to avoid unintended transaction states.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting Common Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Error: \"Access Denied\" or \"Insufficient Privileges\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cause:** The user executing the procedure or function lacks the necessary permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "- Grant appropriate privileges using the `GRANT` statement.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION Procedures.CalculateTax TO 'username'@'host';\n",
    "  GRANT EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE Procedures.ComputeTotal TO 'username'@'host';\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Error: \"Function execution failed\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cause:** Issues within the called function, such as logic errors, type mismatches, or violations of MySQL's function restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "- Review the function's logic and ensure it adheres to MySQL's stored function limitations.\n",
    "- Check for data type compatibility and correct any mismatches.\n",
    "- Implement proper error handling within functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Performance Degradation**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cause:** Excessive or inefficient nested function calls, leading to slow query execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "- Optimize individual functions for performance.\n",
    "- Minimize unnecessary nested calls.\n",
    "- Use indexing and query optimization techniques where applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Unexpected Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cause:** Logical errors within the functions or incorrect assumptions about data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "- Test functions individually to verify their correctness.\n",
    "- Use `SELECT` statements to debug and inspect intermediate results.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT CalculateTax(100.00) AS TaxAmount;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Recursion Limit Exceeded**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cause:** Functions calling themselves recursively without a proper termination condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "- Ensure recursive functions have a well-defined base case to terminate recursion.\n",
    "- Consider iterative approaches if recursion depth becomes an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling stored functions within other stored functions or procedures is a powerful feature in MySQL that promotes code reusability and modularity. By adhering to best practices and being mindful of MySQL's limitations and considerations, you can effectively leverage this capability to build robust and maintainable database applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Yes, you can call stored functions within other functions or procedures in MySQL.**\n",
    "- **Ensure data type compatibility and adhere to MySQL's restrictions on stored functions.**\n",

    "- **Stored Procedures**:\n",
    "  - Can perform multiple operations, including `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.\n",
    "  - Can return multiple values or result sets.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Error Handling Limitations in Stored Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limited Use of Handlers**: Unlike stored procedures, stored functions have restrictions on using `DECLARE ... HANDLER` for error handling.\n",
    "- **Restrictions on Data Modification**: Stored functions cannot perform operations that modify data (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`), which limits the scope of potential errors.\n",
    "- **No Transaction Control**: Stored functions cannot start, commit, or rollback transactions, restricting advanced error management.\n",

    "\n",
    "In MySQL, the `DECLARE ... HANDLER` statement allows you to define how to respond to specific conditions (such as errors or warnings) that occur within a stored function or procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",

    "- **No `GET DIAGNOSTICS`**: Unlike stored procedures, you cannot retrieve detailed error information within functions.\n",
    "- **Cannot Use Handlers to Modify Control Flow Extensively**: Handlers in functions are limited in how they can alter the flow of execution.\n",

    "## Best Practices for Error Handling in Stored Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use `SIGNAL` for Custom Errors**:\n",
    "   - Employ the `SIGNAL` statement to raise meaningful, custom error messages when input validation fails or when specific business rules are violated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Implement Conditional Checks**:\n",
    "   - Before performing operations that could fail (like division), check for conditions that might cause errors and handle them gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Handlers Sparingly**:\n",
    "   - While handlers can be useful, overusing them or using them inappropriately can make your function logic complex and harder to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Provide Clear Error Messages**:\n",
    "   - When raising errors, ensure that the `MESSAGE_TEXT` is descriptive enough to aid in debugging and inform the user of the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Keep Functions Deterministic When Possible**:\n",
    "   - Declare functions as `DETERMINISTIC` if they always produce the same output for the same input. This can help with performance optimizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Avoid Data Modification in Functions**:\n",
    "   - Since stored functions should ideally be side-effect-free, refrain from performing `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations within them.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Test Thoroughly**:\n",
    "   - Rigorously test your functions with various inputs, including edge cases, to ensure that error handling works as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Limited Error Information**:\n",
    "   - Stored functions cannot retrieve detailed error information using `GET DIAGNOSTICS`, which limits the ability to handle errors based on their specifics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **No Transaction Control**:\n",
    "   - Functions cannot manage transactions (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`), so they cannot undo changes if an error occurs within a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cannot Use Certain Statements**:\n",
    "   - Stored functions cannot execute statements that produce results (`SELECT` statements that return result sets), nor can they call stored procedures that modify data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Performance Implications**:\n",
    "   - Raising errors within functions can impact performance, especially if the function is called frequently within large queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Recursion Limitations**:\n",
    "   - MySQL allows recursion in stored functions, but excessive recursion can lead to stack overflows and performance issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Error Propagation**:\n",
    "   - Errors raised within a function will propagate to the calling context, which means that the calling procedure or application must be prepared to handle them.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternative Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the limitations of error handling in stored functions, consider the following alternatives when more robust error management is required:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use Stored Procedures Instead of Functions**:\n",
    "   - Stored procedures offer more flexible error-handling capabilities, including the use of `DECLARE ... HANDLER` for various conditions and the ability to manage transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   DELIMITER //\n",
    "\n",
    "   CREATE PROCEDURE SafeDivideProc(IN dividend DECIMAL(10,2), IN divisor DECIMAL(10,2), OUT result DECIMAL(10,2))\n",
    "   BEGIN\n",
    "       DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR DIVISION_BY_ZERO SET result = NULL;\n",
    "\n",
    "       SET result = dividend / divisor;\n",
    "   END;\n",
    "   //\n",
    "\n",
    "   DELIMITER ;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Application-Level Error Handling**:\n",
    "   - Handle errors within your application code rather than solely relying on database-level error handling. This provides more control and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Example in Python using MySQL Connector\n",
    "   import mysql.connector\n",
    "   from mysql.connector import errorcode\n",
    "\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # Assume connection is established\n",
    "       cursor.callproc('ValidateAge', [age, result])\n",
    "   except mysql.connector.Error as err:\n",
    "       if err.errno == errorcode.ER_SIGNAL_EXCEPTION:\n",
    "           print(f\"Error: {err.msg}\")\n",
    "       else:\n",
    "           print(f\"Unexpected error: {err}\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Conditional Logic to Return Status Codes**:\n",
    "   - Instead of raising errors, design functions to return status codes or special values indicating success or failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   DELIMITER //\n",
    "\n",
    "   CREATE FUNCTION CheckPositiveNumber(num INT)\n",
    "   RETURNS BOOLEAN\n",
    "   DETERMINISTIC\n",
    "   BEGIN\n",
    "       IF num < 0 THEN\n",
    "           RETURN FALSE;\n",

    "   //\n",
    "\n",
    "   DELIMITER ;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Leverage Triggers for Data Integrity**:\n",
    "   - Use triggers to enforce data integrity rules, which can help in managing errors related to data modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   DELIMITER //\n",
    "\n",
    "   CREATE TRIGGER before_insert_my_table\n",

    "## Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "Error handling within MySQL stored functions is possible but comes with notable limitations. By leveraging the `SIGNAL` statement and conditional logic, you can manage certain error conditions effectively. However, for more complex error-handling requirements, consider using stored procedures or handling errors at the application level.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use `SIGNAL` for Raising Custom Errors**: Utilize the `SIGNAL` statement to enforce business rules and validate inputs within functions.\n",
    "- **Implement Conditional Checks**: Proactively check for error-prone conditions before performing operations that might fail.\n",
    "- **Understand the Limitations**: Recognize the constraints of stored functions in terms of error handling to design your database logic accordingly.\n",
    "- **Consider Alternatives When Necessary**: When stored functions are insufficient for your error-handling needs, explore stored procedures or application-level solutions.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    " In MySQL stored functions and procedures, **handlers** are used to define how the program should respond to specific conditions, such as errors or warnings, that occur during execution. Understanding the common `handler_type` and `condition_value` options is essential for effective error handling and control flow management.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Use Specific Conditions:**\n",
    "   - Target specific `SQLSTATE` values or error codes to handle known error scenarios.\n",
    "   - Avoid using overly broad conditions like `SQLEXCEPTION` unless necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Order of Handler Declarations:**\n",
    "   - Declare more specific handlers before general ones to ensure that specific conditions are caught appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Limit the Use of `UNDO`:**\n",
    "   - Given its complexity and limited use cases, prefer `CONTINUE` and `EXIT` handlers unless you have a specific need for `UNDO`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Keep Handlers Simple:**\n",
    "   - Handlers should perform minimal tasks like logging errors or setting flags. Avoid complex logic within handlers to maintain readability and prevent unexpected behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Test Thoroughly:**\n",
    "   - Rigorously test handlers to ensure they respond correctly to the specified conditions without causing unintended side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Use Handlers to Maintain Control Flow:**\n",
    "   - Utilize `CONTINUE` handlers to manage non-critical issues without interrupting the overall process.\n",
    "   - Use `EXIT` handlers for critical errors where continuation is not feasible or desired.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Selecting Appropriate Handler Types:** Choose between `CONTINUE`, `EXIT`, and `UNDO` based on whether you want to proceed after handling the condition or abort the execution.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Always Test Handlers:** Verify that your handlers respond as expected under various conditions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Document Your Handlers:** Clearly comment your code to indicate what each handler is responsible for, enhancing maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stay Updated:** MySQL continues to evolve, so keep abreast of new features or changes in error handling mechanisms in newer versions.\n",
