    "I understand your confusion. The term \"CONTAINS SQL\" in MySQL can be a bit abstract because it deals with the structure and operations inside a stored function or procedure rather than direct data interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What Does \"CONTAINS SQL\" Mean?**\n",
    "\n",
    "When we say a function \"CONTAINS SQL,\" it means that the function includes SQL statements, but those statements do not read from or modify the data in the database. Essentially, the SQL code in such functions might involve declaring variables, performing calculations, setting values, or handling control flow (like loops and conditional statements) without actually querying or altering the tables in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Examples of SQL Logic in \"CONTAINS SQL\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of what SQL logic might look like in a \"CONTAINS SQL\" function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Variable Declarations:**\n",
    "   - Declaring variables to store temporary values.\n",
    "   - Example: `DECLARE total_sales INT;`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Assignments:**\n",
    "   - Assigning values to variables.\n",
    "   - Example: `SET total_sales = 1000;`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Control Flow Statements:**\n",
    "   - Using `IF`, `CASE`, `LOOP`, or other control structures to manage logic within the function.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     IF total_sales > 1000 THEN\n",
    "         SET discount = 0.1;\n",
    "     ELSE\n",
    "         SET discount = 0.05;\n",
    "     END IF;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Point of \"CONTAINS SQL\":**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No Interaction with Database Tables:** \n",
    "  - The key characteristic of a \"CONTAINS SQL\" function is that it does not involve any operations that interact with the data in the database tables. It doesn't perform `SELECT` queries to read data or `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` operations to modify data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example of a \"CONTAINS SQL\" Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a simple example of a function that fits the \"CONTAINS SQL\" category:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE FUNCTION calculate_discount(price DECIMAL(10,2))\n",
    "RETURNS DECIMAL(10,2)\n",
    "CONTAINS SQL\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    DECLARE discount_rate DECIMAL(3,2);\n",
    "    \n",
    "    IF price > 100 THEN\n",
    "        SET discount_rate = 0.10;\n",
    "    ELSE\n",
    "        SET discount_rate = 0.05;\n",
    "    END IF;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    RETURN price * discount_rate;\n",
    "END;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** The function `calculate_discount` determines a discount rate based on the price.\n",
    "- **Logic:** It uses an `IF` statement to decide the discount rate:\n",
    "  - If the price is greater than 100, it sets the discount rate to 10%.\n",
    "  - Otherwise, it sets the discount rate to 5%.\n",
    "- **Return Value:** It returns the calculated discount amount.\n",
    "- **No Data Interaction:** The function does not query any tables or modify any data; it only uses internal logic to compute a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **When to Use \"CONTAINS SQL\":**\n",
    "\n",
    "You use \"CONTAINS SQL\" when your function:\n",
    "- **Includes SQL statements**, such as `DECLARE`, `SET`, or control flow statements (`IF`, `CASE`, `LOOP`), but\n",
    "- **Does not perform operations** that interact with the database data (no `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` statements).\n",

This distinction is important for performance optimization, particularly in caching and replication contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. DETERMINISTIC**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** A function is `DETERMINISTIC` if it always returns the same result when called with the same input parameters. This means that the function does not rely on any external factors or state that could change between calls.\n",
    "- **Use Case:** Use `DETERMINISTIC` when your function's result is based solely on its input parameters and does not depend on:\n",
    "  - Current date or time (`NOW()`, `CURDATE()`)\n",
    "  - Random numbers (`RAND()`)\n",
    "  - Data that may change (`SELECT` from a table that could be modified)\n",

    "      RETURN 3.14159 * radius * radius;\n",
    "  END;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Explanation:** \n",
    "  - The function `calculate_area` calculates the area of a circle given a radius. \n",
    "  - The result only depends on the value of `radius` and the constant π (3.14159).\n",
    "  - For the same `radius`, it will always return the same area, so it's `DETERMINISTIC`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. NOT DETERMINISTIC**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** A function is `NOT DETERMINISTIC` if it can return different results when called with the same input parameters. This usually happens because the function relies on some external state or non-deterministic elements.\n",
    "- **Use Case:** Use `NOT DETERMINISTIC` when your function's result could vary even if the input parameters remain the same. Examples include:\n",
    "  - Functions that use the current date or time (`NOW()`, `CURDATE()`)\n",
    "  - Functions that generate random numbers (`RAND()`)\n",
    "  - Functions that query tables where data might change (`SELECT` that reads a table subject to updates)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  CREATE FUNCTION get_current_date_time()\n",
    "  RETURNS DATETIME\n",
    "  NOT DETERMINISTIC\n",
    "  BEGIN\n",
    "      RETURN NOW();\n",
    "  END;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Explanation:**\n",
    "  - The function `get_current_date_time` returns the current date and time.\n",
    "  - Even with no parameters, calling it at different times will produce different results.\n",
    "  - Therefore, it is `NOT DETERMINISTIC`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **When to Use Each**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use `DETERMINISTIC`** if:\n",
    "  - Your function's output is solely determined by its input parameters.\n",
    "  - There are no external factors, like time, random numbers, or changing data, that could affect the result.\n",
    "  - Example scenarios: mathematical calculations, string manipulations, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use `NOT DETERMINISTIC`** if:\n",
    "  - Your function's output can vary even with the same input parameters.\n",
    "  - The function depends on variables that can change, such as the current time, random numbers, or data in tables that may be modified.\n",
    "  - Example scenarios: retrieving the current date/time, generating random numbers, querying tables with dynamic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why It Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performance Optimization:**\n",
    "  - MySQL can optimize query execution if it knows that a function is `DETERMINISTIC`. For example, it might cache results to avoid recalculating them unnecessarily.\n",
    "  - For `NOT DETERMINISTIC` functions, MySQL cannot assume that a result can be reused, so it may recompute the function every time it’s called.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Replication:**\n",
    "  - In MySQL replication, using `DETERMINISTIC` functions ensures consistency across the master and replica databases. \n",
    "  - Using `NOT DETERMINISTIC` functions could lead to different results on the master and replica because the function might produce different outcomes when executed at different times.\n",
    "\n",

    "In MySQL, the semicolon (`;`) is used as the default statement delimiter. It indicates the end of a SQL statement, allowing MySQL to understand where one statement finishes and another begins. Here’s a detailed explanation of when to use the semicolon:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **When to Use Semicolons (`;`) in MySQL:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ending SQL Statements:**\n",
    "   - **General Usage:** A semicolon is used to terminate a SQL statement. This is necessary when executing multiple statements in a single query or script.\n",
    "   - **Examples:**\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     SELECT * FROM customers;\n",
    "     UPDATE orders SET status = 'shipped' WHERE order_id = 123;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inside Stored Programs (Functions, Procedures, Triggers):**\n",
    "   - **Within `BEGIN ... END` Blocks:** When writing stored procedures, functions, or triggers, you need to terminate each statement inside the `BEGIN ... END` block with a semicolon.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     DELIMITER //\n",
    "\n",
    "     CREATE FUNCTION area_calculation(radius FLOAT)\n",
    "     RETURNS FLOAT\n",
    "     BEGIN\n",
    "         DECLARE area FLOAT;\n",
    "         SET area = radius * radius * PI();\n",
    "         RETURN area;\n",
    "     END //\n",
    "\n",
    "     DELIMITER ;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** The semicolon terminates each SQL statement inside the function, like `DECLARE`, `SET`, and `RETURN`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **After `DELIMITER` Statement:**\n",
    "   - **To Change Delimiters:** When changing the delimiter using the `DELIMITER` command, you typically do not use a semicolon after the `DELIMITER` keyword itself, but you do use a semicolon when resetting the delimiter back to its default.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     DELIMITER //\n",
    "     -- Function or procedure code here\n",
    "     DELIMITER ;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **When Not to Use Semicolons:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Statement Queries:**\n",
    "   - In many interactive MySQL environments (like MySQL command-line, or single statements in a GUI), a single query can be executed without needing a semicolon if it’s the only statement being executed.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     SELECT * FROM customers\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Within `DELIMITER` Re-Definitions:**\n",
    "   - When defining or changing a delimiter (e.g., `DELIMITER //`), you don’t need to end that particular line with a semicolon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Always use semicolons** to terminate SQL statements in scripts, within stored procedures, functions, triggers, and when writing multiple statements in a sequence.\n",
    "- **In stored programs** (`BEGIN ... END` blocks), every SQL statement should end with a semicolon.\n",
    "- **No semicolon is needed** immediately after the `DELIMITER` command itself, but when resetting the delimiter to `;`, it’s used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the proper use of semicolons helps in writing clear, error-free SQL code and managing complex scripts effectively."

    "\n",
    "### **Why You Don't Need to Redefine the Delimiter:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single Statement Execution:** In these environments, each SQL query or block of SQL code is treated as a single statement, so there’s no need to change the delimiter. The SQL statements are executed one at a time, and the default semicolon (`;`) works fine to terminate each statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No Support for `DELIMITER` Command:** The `DELIMITER` command is specific to MySQL's command-line client and some GUI tools. It is not recognized by the MySQL server itself or by connectors like PyMySQL, SQLAlchemy, or `ipython-sql`. Therefore, trying to use `DELIMITER` in these contexts will result in a syntax error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Practical Implication:**\n",
    "- When working in environments like Jupyter Notebook with `ipython-sql`, you simply write your SQL code with regular semicolons to terminate statements.\n",
    "- You can define functions, procedures, or any other SQL code without worrying about delimiter issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example Without Redefining Delimiter:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how you can create a function in Jupyter Notebook without needing to redefine the delimiter:\n",

    "### Example: Declaring Multiple Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE FUNCTION calculate_sales_metrics()\n",
    "RETURNS DECIMAL(10,2)\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    DECLARE total_sales DECIMAL(10,2);\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Use an OUT Parameter in a Stored Procedure:**\n",
    "   - Unlike functions, stored procedures can have multiple `OUT` parameters, which allows you to return multiple values.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:**\n",

    "       SELECT MAX(amount) INTO max_sales FROM sales;\n",
    "   END;\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "   CALL get_sales_summary(@total, @average, @max);\n",
    "   SELECT @total, @average, @max;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Return a Result Set:**\n",
    "   - Another approach is to return a result set, which is like returning a table of data with multiple columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE PROCEDURE get_sales_summary()\n",

    "\n",
    "DELIMITER ;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- The `check_stock` procedure takes two parameters: the `product_id` (input) and `message` (output).\n",

    "- The `IF...THEN` block checks if the stock quantity is greater than 0:\n",

    "The reason for using `@message` when calling the stored procedure lies in how MySQL handles **output parameters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difference Between Procedure Parameters and User-defined Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Output Parameter (`OUT`)**: In your stored procedure, the `OUT` parameter (`message`) is used to pass data back from the procedure to the caller.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Session Variable (`@message`)**: The `@message` is a **session-level user-defined variable** in MySQL. When you call the stored procedure, you need to pass a variable that can hold the value being returned by the `OUT` parameter. MySQL uses session variables (like `@message`) to store and retrieve output values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use `@message`?\n",
    "\n",
    "When calling the stored procedure with an `OUT` parameter, you need a place to store the returned value outside the procedure. Session variables, denoted by `@`, are used to capture the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inside the stored procedure**: The `OUT` parameter `message` is defined to return a value from the procedure.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **When calling the procedure**: The caller (you) needs to provide a session variable (`@message`) to receive the output from the procedure. This is why you pass `@message` when calling the procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure itself does not know about the `@message` session variable. It only knows about its own `OUT` parameter `message`. However, when the procedure completes, MySQL assigns the value of the `OUT` parameter (`message`) to the user-defined variable `@message`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flow:\n",
    "1. The procedure assigns a value to its `OUT` parameter (`message`).\n",
    "2. After the procedure finishes, MySQL copies the value of the `OUT` parameter (`message`) into the session variable (`@message`).\n",
    "3. You can then access the value of `@message` using `SELECT @message;`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Without `@message` Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you call the procedure without using a session variable like `@message`, there would be no place to store the result from the `OUT` parameter, and you wouldn't be able to retrieve or use the output value. That's why `@message` is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Recap:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CALL check_stock(1, @message);\n",
    "SELECT @message;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `CALL check_stock(1, @message);`: Calls the procedure, and after execution, assigns the result of the `OUT` parameter `message` to the session variable `@message`.\n",
    "- `SELECT @message;`: Retrieves and displays the value stored in the session variable `@message`.\n",

    "1. WHILE loop\n",
    "2. REPEAT loop\n",
    "3. LOOP with LEAVE\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go over each loop type in MySQL in detail to better understand how they work and when to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. WHILE Loop in MySQL\n",
    "\n",
    "The `WHILE` loop allows you to repeat a block of code as long as a specified condition is `TRUE`. The loop will first check the condition before executing the code inside the loop. If the condition is false at the start, the loop will not run.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure of the WHILE Loop**:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "WHILE condition DO\n",
    "   -- statements\n",
    "END WHILE;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Explanation:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DELIMITER $$\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE PROCEDURE while_loop_example()\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    DECLARE counter INT DEFAULT 1; -- Declaring a variable 'counter' with an initial value of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "    WHILE counter <= 5 DO -- The loop continues as long as 'counter' is less than or equal to 5.\n",
    "        -- The block inside the loop will be executed repeatedly.\n",
    "        SELECT CONCAT('Counter value: ', counter); -- Outputs the current value of 'counter'.\n",
    "\n",
    "        SET counter = counter + 1; -- Increments 'counter' by 1 after each iteration.\n",
    "    END WHILE;\n",
    "END$$\n",
    "\n",
    "DELIMITER ;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`DECLARE counter`**: This creates a local variable `counter` which keeps track of the number of iterations. It starts with the value 1.\n",
    "- **`WHILE counter <= 5 DO`**: The condition is checked before each iteration. As long as the `counter` is less than or equal to 5, the block of code inside the `WHILE` loop will execute.\n",
    "- **`SET counter = counter + 1`**: After each iteration, the counter is increased by 1 to avoid an infinite loop.\n",
    "- The loop stops when the counter exceeds 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. REPEAT Loop in MySQL\n",
    "\n",
    "The `REPEAT` loop is similar to the `WHILE` loop, but it checks the condition **after** executing the block of code. This means the block of code is executed **at least once**, regardless of the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure of the REPEAT Loop**:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "REPEAT\n",
    "   -- statements\n",
    "UNTIL condition\n",
    "END REPEAT;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Explanation:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DELIMITER $$\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE PROCEDURE repeat_loop_example()\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    DECLARE counter INT DEFAULT 1; -- Declares a variable 'counter' initialized to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "    REPEAT\n",
    "        SELECT CONCAT('Counter value: ', counter); -- Outputs the current value of 'counter'.\n",
    "        SET counter = counter + 1; -- Increments 'counter' by 1 after each iteration.\n",
    "    UNTIL counter > 5 -- The loop continues until 'counter' exceeds 5.\n",
    "    END REPEAT;\n",
    "END$$\n",
    "\n",
    "DELIMITER ;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`REPEAT`**: The block of code inside the `REPEAT` loop will run at least once.\n",
    "- **`UNTIL counter > 5`**: The condition is checked after the block of code executes. In this case, the loop will continue until the counter becomes greater than 5.\n",
    "- **`SELECT CONCAT('Counter value: ', counter)`**: Prints the current counter value.\n",
    "- **`SET counter = counter + 1`**: This increments the counter by 1 after each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike `WHILE`, `REPEAT` does not check the condition at the start, so it always executes the block of code at least once.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. LOOP with LEAVE in MySQL\n",
    "\n",
    "The `LOOP` construct is another way of creating a loop in MySQL. It doesn't have a condition tied to it directly like `WHILE` or `REPEAT`. Instead, you explicitly control when the loop should exit by using the `LEAVE` statement. You can place a condition inside the loop and use `LEAVE` to stop the loop when the condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure of the LOOP**:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "label_name: LOOP\n",
    "   -- statements\n",
    "   IF condition THEN\n",
    "      LEAVE label_name;\n",
    "   END IF;\n",
    "END LOOP;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Explanation:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DELIMITER $$\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE PROCEDURE simple_loop_example()\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    DECLARE counter INT DEFAULT 1; -- Declare 'counter' initialized to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "    simple_loop: LOOP -- Label the loop as 'simple_loop'. This allows you to reference it when using 'LEAVE'.\n",
    "        IF counter > 5 THEN\n",
    "            LEAVE simple_loop; -- Exits the loop when 'counter' is greater than 5.\n",
    "        END IF;\n",
    "\n",
    "        SELECT CONCAT('Counter value: ', counter); -- Outputs the current value of 'counter'.\n",
    "        SET counter = counter + 1; -- Increments 'counter' by 1 after each iteration.\n",
    "    END LOOP; -- The loop repeats unless 'LEAVE' is called.\n",
    "END$$\n",
    "\n",
    "DELIMITER ;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`simple_loop: LOOP`**: The `LOOP` starts here. `simple_loop` is the label that identifies this loop. Labels are useful when you have nested loops and want to specify which loop to exit.\n",
    "- **`IF counter > 5 THEN LEAVE simple_loop`**: This checks if the counter is greater than 5. If it is, the `LEAVE` statement exits the loop.\n",
    "- **`SET counter = counter + 1`**: This increments the counter by 1 after each iteration, so eventually, the condition to leave the loop will be met.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of loop is useful when you want to control the exit condition within the loop and when the condition is not necessarily at the start or end of the loop body.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "- **WHILE Loop**: The condition is checked before the block of code runs. If the condition is `FALSE` initially, the loop won't run at all.\n",
    "- **REPEAT Loop**: The block of code runs at least once, and the condition is checked after each execution of the loop.\n",
    "- **LOOP with LEAVE**: The `LOOP` construct doesn’t have a condition built in. You control the loop’s exit using `LEAVE`, which allows for flexibility on where and how the loop terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases for Each Loop Type\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **WHILE Loop**: Best when you want to check a condition before running the loop. For example, iterating through a set of data when the number of iterations is unknown at the start.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **REPEAT Loop**: Useful when the loop body should always execute at least once, regardless of the condition. This can be applied in situations like prompting a user until valid input is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **LOOP with LEAVE**: Ideal when you want complete control over when the loop should exit, such as complex logic requiring early termination inside a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the Stored Procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "To run any of these loops, you need to:\n",
    "1. Define the stored procedure.\n",
    "2. Call the procedure using the `CALL` statement:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CALL procedure_name();\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples give you flexibility depending on your requirements for looping in MySQL."

    "In the examples provided, there are no `IN`, `OUT`, or `INOUT` parameters because the stored procedures were designed to demonstrate the functionality of loops within MySQL without needing any input or output from the user. However, MySQL stored procedures can indeed use parameters when you need to pass data into the procedure or return data from it. Let's break down when and how to use these parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Parameters in MySQL Stored Procedures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **IN Parameter**: Used to pass a value **into** the procedure. This value is treated as read-only inside the procedure.\n",
    "2. **OUT Parameter**: Used to return a value **out** of the procedure to the caller.\n",
    "3. **INOUT Parameter**: Can be used both to pass a value into the procedure and to return a modified value back to the caller.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let’s modify the previous examples to include parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: WHILE Loop with `IN` Parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "This example takes an `IN` parameter and loops based on the value passed to it.\n",

    "    END WHILE;\n",
    "END$$\n",
    "\n",
    "DELIMITER ;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the `max_counter` parameter is passed to the procedure, which defines how many times the loop should run. To call this procedure:\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "CALL while_loop_example(5); -- Loops until counter is 5\n",
    "```\n",

    "    UNTIL counter > max_counter\n",
    "    END REPEAT;\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Set the final value of the counter to be returned as OUT parameter\n",

    "END$$\n",
    "\n",
    "DELIMITER ;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`IN max_counter`**: Defines the limit for the loop (how many iterations).\n",
    "- **`OUT final_counter`**: Returns the final value of the counter after the loop ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "To call this procedure and capture the output value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SET @final_value = 0;\n",

    "END$$\n",
    "\n",
    "DELIMITER ;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`INOUT counter`**: The `counter` parameter is passed in and modified by the loop. After the procedure finishes, the modified value of `counter` is returned.\n",
    "\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "SET @counter = 1;\n",
    "CALL simple_loop_example(@counter);\n",
    "SELECT @counter;\n",

    "Here, the initial value of `@counter` is 1, and after the loop runs, the final value of `@counter` will be the value after the loop terminates (in this case, 6).\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IN Parameters**: Use these when the procedure needs some input from the caller to define how the procedure behaves. For example, in the `WHILE` and `REPEAT` loop examples, the `IN` parameter (`max_counter`) defines how many times the loop will run.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OUT Parameters**: Use these when you want the procedure to return data back to the caller. In the `REPEAT` loop example, the procedure returns the final value of the counter after the loop completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **INOUT Parameters**: Use these when you want to pass a value into the procedure, modify it within the procedure, and then return the modified value to the caller. This is demonstrated in the `LOOP` example, where the `counter` is passed in and incremented, and the modified value is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parameters are not always necessary. If your procedure only needs to perform a task without requiring any external input or without returning a result, then no parameters are needed (as shown in the original examples).\n",
    "- Use **`IN`** when you need input, **`OUT`** when you want to return a value, and **`INOUT`** when the value needs to be passed in, modified, and then returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "By incorporating parameters, you can make stored procedures much more flexible and reusable."
