    "MySQL supports several powerful **window functions** that allow you to perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row. These are useful for analytical tasks like ranking, running totals, moving averages, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s a list of common **window functions** in MySQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. `ROW_NUMBER()`**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Assigns a unique sequential integer to rows within a partition of the result set, starting at 1 for each partition.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT id, name, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank\n",
    "  FROM employees;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. `RANK()`**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Assigns a rank to each row within a partition, with gaps in ranks when there are ties.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT id, name, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank\n",
    "  FROM employees;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. `DENSE_RANK()`**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Similar to `RANK()`, but without gaps in rank values for tied rows.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT id, name, DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dense_rank\n",
    "  FROM employees;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. `NTILE(n)`**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Divides rows in each partition into `n` groups, assigning a group number to each row.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT id, name, NTILE(4) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS quartile\n",
    "  FROM employees;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. `LAG()`**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Retrieves data from the previous row in the same result set partition.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT id, name, salary, LAG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary) AS previous_salary\n",
    "  FROM employees;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. `LEAD()`**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Retrieves data from the next row in the same result set partition.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT id, name, salary, LEAD(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary) AS next_salary\n",
    "  FROM employees;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. `FIRST_VALUE()`**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Returns the first value in an ordered partition.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT id, name, salary, FIRST_VALUE(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary) AS lowest_salary\n",
    "  FROM employees;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. `LAST_VALUE()`**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Returns the last value in an ordered partition.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT id, name, salary, LAST_VALUE(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS highest_salary\n",
    "  FROM employees;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **9. `CUME_DIST()` (Cumulative Distribution)**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Calculates the cumulative distribution of a value within a partition.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT id, name, salary, CUME_DIST() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary) AS cumulative_distribution\n",
    "  FROM employees;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **10. `PERCENT_RANK()`**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Calculates the relative rank of a row as a percentage of the total rows in the partition.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT id, name, salary, PERCENT_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary) AS percent_rank\n",
    "  FROM employees;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **11. Aggregate Functions as Window Functions**\n",
    "In addition to the above, aggregate functions like `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`, and `COUNT()` can be used as window functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Examples**:\n",
    "- **Running Total**:\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT id, name, salary, SUM(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary) AS running_total\n",
    "  FROM employees;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Average Salary by Department**:\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT id, name, salary, AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) AS avg_salary\n",
    "  FROM employees;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **12. `NTH_VALUE()`**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Returns the nth value in an ordered partition.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT id, name, salary, NTH_VALUE(salary, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary) AS second_lowest_salary\n",
    "  FROM employees;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Notes**\n",
    "1. **`OVER()` Clause**:\n",
    "   - Defines the window for the function.\n",
    "   - Can include `PARTITION BY` to group rows and `ORDER BY` to sort rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Partitioning**:\n",
    "   - Without `PARTITION BY`, the function operates over the entire result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Performance**:\n",
    "   - Window functions can be resource-intensive, especially with large datasets. Use with appropriate indexing and optimizations.\n",
    "\n",
