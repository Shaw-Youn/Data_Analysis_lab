    "## A. Window Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In MySQL, **window functions** allow you to perform calculations across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row. Unlike regular aggregate functions, window functions do not cause rows to become grouped into a single output row; instead, rows retain their separate identities, and the aggregate function is applied over the window of rows. Window functions are often used in scenarios involving ranking, running totals, moving averages, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **window** in this context is a group of rows defined by the `OVER()` clause, which controls how rows are partitioned and ordered for the window function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Window Functions in MySQL\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`ROW_NUMBER()`**: Assigns a unique sequential integer to rows within a partition of a result set.\n",
    "2. **`RANK()`**: Similar to `ROW_NUMBER()`, but rows with equal values in the ORDER BY clause receive the same rank, and gaps may appear.\n",
    "3. **`DENSE_RANK()`**: Like `RANK()`, but it assigns consecutive ranks without gaps.\n",
    "4. **`NTILE(n)`**: Divides the result set into `n` buckets and assigns a bucket number to each row.\n",
    "5. **`LAG()`**: Provides access to the value of a row at a given physical offset before the current row.\n",
    "6. **`LEAD()`**: Provides access to the value of a row at a given physical offset after the current row.\n",
    "7. **`SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`**: Aggregate functions that can be used as window functions with the `OVER()` clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "window_function([arguments]) OVER (\n",
    "    [PARTITION BY partition_expression]\n",
    "    [ORDER BY order_expression]\n",
    "    [ROWS or RANGE frame_definition]\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: `ROW_NUMBER()`\n",
    "Let's assign a unique row number to each employee based on their salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT employee_id, first_name, salary,\n",
    "       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this query:\n",
    "- The `ROW_NUMBER()` function assigns a unique number to each row.\n",
    "- The `ORDER BY salary DESC` orders the rows by salary in descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: `RANK()` and `DENSE_RANK()`\n",
    "Let's rank employees based on their salary, and handle cases where multiple employees have the same salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT employee_id, first_name, salary,\n",
    "       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank,\n",
    "       DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dense_rank\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `RANK()` function assigns the same rank to employees with the same salary but skips ranks when there are ties.\n",
    "- The `DENSE_RANK()` function assigns the same rank to employees with the same salary without skipping ranks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3: `LAG()` and `LEAD()`\n",
    "You can use `LAG()` to access a value from the previous row, and `LEAD()` to access a value from the next row.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT employee_id, first_name, salary,\n",
    "       LAG(salary, 1) OVER (ORDER BY salary) AS previous_salary,\n",
    "       LEAD(salary, 1) OVER (ORDER BY salary) AS next_salary\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `LAG(salary, 1)` gets the salary from the previous row.\n",
    "- `LEAD(salary, 1)` gets the salary from the next row.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 4: Running Total with `SUM()`\n",
    "To calculate a running total of employee salaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT employee_id, first_name, salary,\n",
    "       SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary) AS running_total\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `SUM(salary)` computes the running total of the salary column as we move down the result set, ordered by `salary`.\n",

    "If you want to rank employees within their departments, you can use the `PARTITION BY` clause.\n",

    "## B. `LAG()` and `LEAD()` Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**`LAG()`** and **`LEAD()`** are powerful window functions in MySQL that allow you to access data from a previous or subsequent row within the result set, without the need for complex self-joins or subqueries. They are especially useful for performing calculations that involve comparing a row with its preceding or following row, such as computing differences over time, identifying trends, or performing cumulative analyses.\n",

    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "LAG(expression [, offset [, default_value]]) OVER (\n",

    "- **`expression`**: The column or calculation you want to retrieve from another row.\n",
    "- **`offset`** *(optional)*: The number of rows backward (`LAG`) or forward (`LEAD`) from the current row. Default is `1`.\n",
    "- **`default_value`** *(optional)*: The value returned if the offset goes beyond the scope of the partition (e.g., when there is no previous or next row). Default is `NULL`.\n",
    "- **`OVER` clause**: Defines the window or set of rows to operate over, which can include `PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How They Work**\n",

    "- **`ORDER BY salary`** orders employees within each department by salary.\n",
    "- **`LAG(salary, 1)`** fetches the previous salary within the department.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Time Series Analysis**: Compare current values with previous or next periods (e.g., stock prices, sales figures).\n",
    "2. **Data Gaps Identification**: Detect missing data points by comparing timestamps.\n",
    "3. **Change Detection**: Identify when a value changes compared to the previous or next record.\n",
    "4. **Calculating Differences**: Compute differences in measurements, such as temperature changes.\n",
    "5. **Sessionization**: Determine the duration of sessions or time between events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Points to Remember**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Order of Rows**: The `ORDER BY` clause in the `OVER()` clause determines the sequence of rows for the window function.\n",
    "- **Partitioning**: Use `PARTITION BY` to group data into partitions where the window function is applied independently.\n",
    "- **Handling `NULL` Values**: If there is no preceding or following row (e.g., the first or last row), the functions return `NULL` unless a default value is specified.\n",
    "- **Performance**: Window functions are generally efficient but be cautious with very large datasets and complex window definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advanced Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example 6: Cumulative Sum Using `LAG()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "While `LAG()` isn't typically used for cumulative sums, you can create complex calculations by combining it with other functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    transaction_date,\n",
    "    amount,\n",

    "        LAG(amount, 1) OVER (ORDER BY transaction_date),\n",
    "        0\n",
    "    ) AS cumulative_amount\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "    transactions\n",
    "ORDER BY\n",
    "    transaction_date;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This example demonstrates adding the current amount to the previous amount to get a running total.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example 7: Comparing Non-Adjacent Rows**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can specify an offset greater than 1 to compare non-adjacent rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    date,\n",
    "    temperature,\n",
    "    LAG(temperature, 7) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS temperature_last_week,\n",
    "    temperature - LAG(temperature, 7) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS temperature_change_week\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "    weather_data\n",
    "ORDER BY\n",
    "    date;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compares the temperature on the same day last week to see weekly changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Practical Tips**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Default Values**: Use default values to handle edge cases where there might not be a preceding or following row.\n",
    "- **Multiple `LAG()` or `LEAD()` Calls**: You can use multiple instances in the same query to compare multiple rows back or ahead.\n",
    "- **Combining with Other Window Functions**: Mix `LAG()` and `LEAD()` with other window functions like `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, or aggregates for more complex analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Common Mistakes**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ignoring the `ORDER BY` Clause**: Without proper ordering, the function may not return meaningful results.\n",
    "- **Forgetting `PARTITION BY` When Needed**: If analyzing data within groups, neglecting to partition can lead to incorrect comparisons across groups.\n",
    "- **Not Handling `NULL` Values**: Always consider what should happen when there is no preceding or following row.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`LAG()`** and **`LEAD()`** provide a simple and efficient way to access data from other rows relative to the current one.\n",
    "- They are essential tools for time series analysis, trend identification, and comparative studies.\n",
    "- By mastering these functions, you can write more concise and performant SQL queries that reveal deeper insights into your data.\n",

    "## C.  `IFNULL()` and `COALESCE()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `IFNULL()` function in MySQL is used to return a specified value if the expression being evaluated is `NULL`. If the expression is not `NULL`, the `IFNULL()` function will return the expression itself. It's a simple and useful way to handle `NULL` values in your queries, especially when you want to replace them with a default value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "IFNULL(expression, replacement_value)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`expression`**: The value or column that you want to check for `NULL`.\n",
    "- **`replacement_value`**: The value to return if the expression is `NULL`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **How It Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the `expression` is `NULL`, the `IFNULL()` function returns the `replacement_value`.\n",
    "- If the `expression` is **not** `NULL`, the `IFNULL()` function returns the `expression` itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example 1: Replacing `NULL` in a Column**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a table called `orders` with a column `discount`. Some orders might not have a discount applied, and the `discount` field could be `NULL`. You can use `IFNULL()` to replace `NULL` values with `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT order_id, amount, IFNULL(discount, 0) AS discount\n",
    "FROM orders;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this query:\n",
    "- If the `discount` column is `NULL` for any row, `IFNULL()` will return `0` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example 2: Using `IFNULL()` in Calculations**\n",
    "\n",
    "You might want to calculate the total price for each order, including any discount. If the `discount` column is `NULL`, you can substitute it with `0` so that it doesn’t interfere with your calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT order_id, amount,\n",
    "       amount - IFNULL(discount, 0) AS total_price\n",
    "FROM orders;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that if there is no discount (i.e., the value is `NULL`), the total price is calculated as just the `amount` without subtracting anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example 3: Handling `NULL` in Concatenation**\n",
    "\n",
    "When concatenating strings, `NULL` values can lead to unexpected results. For example, concatenating `NULL` with a string results in `NULL`. You can use `IFNULL()` to handle this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT first_name, last_name,\n",
    "       CONCAT(IFNULL(first_name, ''), ' ', IFNULL(last_name, '')) AS full_name\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- If `first_name` or `last_name` is `NULL`, `IFNULL()` will replace it with an empty string (`''`) so that the concatenation results in a proper full name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example 4: Combining with Other Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can combine `IFNULL()` with other SQL functions for more complex queries. For example, calculating an average where some values might be `NULL`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT AVG(IFNULL(score, 0)) AS average_score\n",
    "FROM student_scores;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- Any `NULL` score is treated as `0` in the average calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Difference Between `IFNULL()` and `COALESCE()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`IFNULL()`**: Only takes two arguments: the expression to check and the replacement value if it is `NULL`.\n",
    "- **`COALESCE()`**: Can take multiple arguments and returns the first non-`NULL` value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of `COALESCE()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT COALESCE(first_name, last_name, 'Unknown') AS name\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- `COALESCE()` will return the first non-`NULL` value in the list of arguments. If `first_name` is `NULL`, it checks `last_name`. If both are `NULL`, it returns `'Unknown'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `IFNULL()` is a simple and effective function for handling `NULL` values in MySQL, replacing them with specified defaults.\n",
    "- It’s commonly used in calculations, concatenations, and any scenario where you want to avoid `NULL` values disrupting your query logic.\n",

    "### **Key Differences from `IFNULL()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`IFNULL()`**: Takes only two arguments. It returns the second argument if the first one is `NULL`.\n",
    "- **`COALESCE()`**: Can take multiple arguments and returns the first non-`NULL` value in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example 1: Basic Usage**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a table `users` with columns `email`, `phone_number`, and `address`. You want to contact users using the first available contact method (email, phone, or address) and show the preferred method of contact.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT user_id,\n",
    "       COALESCE(email, phone_number, address, 'No contact info available') AS preferred_contact\n",
    "FROM users;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `COALESCE(email, phone_number, address, 'No contact info available')` will return the first non-`NULL` value from `email`, `phone_number`, or `address`. \n",
    "- If all three are `NULL`, it returns `'No contact info available'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example 2: Replacing `NULL` with Defaults**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a table `sales` with columns `sale_price` and `discount`. You want to return the discount for a sale, but if the discount is `NULL`, you want to substitute it with a default value of `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT sale_id,\n",
    "       sale_price,\n",
    "       COALESCE(discount, 0) AS discount\n",
    "FROM sales;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- If `discount` is `NULL`, `COALESCE()` will return `0` as the default value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example 3: Combining with Calculations**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `COALESCE()` in calculations where `NULL` values could affect the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT order_id,\n",
    "       product_price * quantity AS total_price,\n",
    "       COALESCE(discount, 0) AS effective_discount,\n",
    "       (product_price * quantity) - COALESCE(discount, 0) AS final_price\n",
    "FROM orders;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- If `discount` is `NULL`, it’s replaced with `0`, ensuring that the final price calculation works properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example 4: Handling Multiple Values**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a table `customers` with columns `preferred_contact_email`, `preferred_contact_phone`, and `preferred_contact_address`, and you want to determine how to contact each customer based on their preferred method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT customer_id,\n",
    "       COALESCE(preferred_contact_email, preferred_contact_phone, preferred_contact_address, 'No contact info available') AS contact_method\n",
    "FROM customers;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- The query will return the first available contact method in the order of preference (email, then phone, then address). If none is available, it will return `'No contact info available'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example 5: Using `COALESCE()` for Multiple Fallbacks**\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where multiple fields might have data, and you want to prioritize the non-`NULL` values, `COALESCE()` comes in handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT employee_id,\n",
    "       COALESCE(bonus, commission, salary * 0.05, 100) AS variable_income\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- The query returns the employee's bonus if available, otherwise their commission, otherwise 5% of their salary, and if all else is `NULL`, it defaults to `100`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example 6: COALESCE with Date Values**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a table of user actions with columns `last_login`, `last_purchase`, and `last_profile_update`, and you want to determine the most recent activity date for each user.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT user_id,\n",
    "       COALESCE(last_login, last_purchase, last_profile_update, '2000-01-01') AS last_activity\n",
    "FROM user_actions;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- The query returns the most recent activity date based on the first non-`NULL` value in the columns. If all activity dates are `NULL`, it returns `'2000-01-01'` as the default.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Comparison: `COALESCE()` vs `IFNULL()`**\n",

    "### **Advanced Example: COALESCE with Multiple Columns**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a table of employee data where some fields may be `NULL`, you can use `COALESCE()` to find the first non-`NULL` value for each employee’s salary data.\n",
    "\n",

    "SELECT employee_id,\n",
    "       COALESCE(base_salary, adjusted_salary, minimum_salary, 30000) AS salary\n",
    "FROM employee_salaries;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- This ensures that if `base_salary` is `NULL`, it checks `adjusted_salary`. If that is also `NULL`, it checks `minimum_salary`, and if all are `NULL`, it defaults to `30,000`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`COALESCE()`** is a versatile function that returns the first non-`NULL` value from a list of values.\n",
    "- It's useful in situations where you need to prioritize non-`NULL` values or provide fallback options.\n",
    "- Unlike `IFNULL()`, which only handles two arguments, `COALESCE()` can handle multiple arguments and gives you more flexibility when working with potentially `NULL` data.\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT department_id, employee_id, salary\n",

    "    SELECT department_id, employee_id, salary,\n",
    "           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank\n",

    "WHERE rank <= 2\n",
    "ORDER BY department_id, salary DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Alias for Subquery**: The inner query (within parentheses) is named `ranked_salaries`. Without this alias, MySQL will throw an error.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Ranking**: The `ROW_NUMBER()` function assigns a unique rank to each employee within their department based on salary in descending order.\n",
    "\n",
